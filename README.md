JunctionX 2020 Exeter Hackathon - Mental Health Track

# Project Outline and Vision
https://www.notion.so/Tech-Stack-205b18ad2ec44224a3484217f90f96d0

In a 4-man team, we attempted to create a Chatbot that gives the user accurate and useful mental health advice. This Chatbot operates on a prototype Kotlin Mobile Application built using Android Studio. 

# Further Work and Future/Upcoming Improvements
In an idealistic scenario, an LSTM architecture would perform phrase-level semantical analysis on most helpful Reddit comments scraped using its open-source API to direct the Chatbot useful sources of information to influence positive changes in mental health.
