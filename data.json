This was the same case with my house fire. Reminding myself of this calmed the fire some. \n\nIt\u2019s very rough losing your possessions. I lost everything I owned, with the exception of a coffee mug. Remember: things can be replaced. It\u2019s VERY hard to look for a positive, but material possessions can be replaced.

With you going through such an incredibly stressful ordeal, your brain needs time to process and cope with it. Keep yourself busy in the mean time with whatever you can. Talk about your feelings and cry if you need to. For sleep, I'd suggest an OTC sleep aid at a low dose or some herbal tea like chamomile or valerian. The most important thing to do is take it easy, take your time, and take care of yourself. I'm so sorry this happened to you... It's absolutely awful.

Essentially, if something really serious happens on the job (death of a child on a call, mass casualty incident etc) then the department is required to hold a CISM meeting.\n\nThe purpose of CISM is to address the traumatic event within 72 hours after it occurs. It is essentially counseling/therapy sessions to talk about and process the incident. The research behind it shows that talking about a traumatic event AS SOON AS POSSIBLE after it happens will greatly reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. \n\nTiming here is huge.

Essentially, if something really serious happens on the job (death of a child on a call, mass casualty incident etc) then the department is required to hold a CISM meeting.\n\nThe purpose of CISM is to address the traumatic event within 72 hours after it occurs. It is essentially counseling/therapy sessions to talk about and process the incident.

I personally can't really speak on the complexities of being non-white in an overly saturated white environment, because I am white.

I managed to pass very well and get a bursary to support me through my whole 4 years at one of the top unis in SA.\n\nAfter that, I entered into a graduate program at a prestigious SA bank and I am now a trader there.\n\nMy colleagues are mostly older white men with a lot of experience in Trading. It doesn't take a long history lesson in Apartheid to understand the privilege they have had since then and how it has disenfranchised them from the rest of the population. I always feel left out (partly because of my distancing myself - that's my fault - but also because of the exclusion that I feel from them). I have also realized that they themselves also do not know how to behave and communicate with me in a relatable way. As a result they choose not to talk to me because that's the easier way out.\n\nA new guy just came into the desk to take on the trading assistant I initially had. She's white and young. They like her so much (especially the Desk head) and I am envious of that but I also blame myself for partly causing this sort of outcome.\n\nAs a consequence I've always felt out of place and I keep asking myself why I deserve to be here every morning before I go to work. I ask myself whether going to the office is worth the money that I earn less the happiness that I sacrifice.\n\nEdit: added some more and fixed typos", "Yeah, here in the US, that disparity between white and \"other\" is definitely an issue that exists too, thanks, in large part, to our history of slavery, jim crow laws, segregation laws and policies, and redlining. All of the upper management people at the company I am interning for are older white men, but I can at least say that they are trying to fix the diversity issue (they launched a diversity and inclusion advisory group and study last year) but when the company has men outnumbering women and your employees are more than 80% white, but the city you serve is 44% black, that's a major concern. I personally can't really speak on the complexities of being non-white in an overly saturated white environment, because I am white. But, I feel like because of my family background, we lived in very culturally diverse areas and even the high school I attended had a majority black student population( so I was actually the minority), I do feel as though I am more keen or sensitive to diversity and inclusion issues in the workplace than most white people.\n\nBut, I totally understand the feeling that I can't relate to these people. Like, one of the Ivy Leaguer interns was going on about how his dad is some sort of Executive for a large oil company or how his parents were deciding which vacation home they were going to buy next. I just get this feeling of deep animosity, and I feel kind of bad that I feel this way, because I'm judging him for his economic status rather than his character or work ethic (which actually kinda sucks). But I just instantly think of all the times, while I was in college, of sending money to my mom to help her buy groceries or pay an overdue utility bill. Meanwhile, his parents paid for his school tuition, paid his rent, paid for literally everything.\n\nIt is a tough situation, because I know I will probably benefit from forming connections with these IvyLeaguers, it will probably help my career in the future (you're probably in the same boat on that topic too), but I just honestly don't like them."]}, {"title": "IS or just extreme self confidence issues?", "id": "f6jici", "score": 2, "subreddit": "ImposterSyndrome", "comments": ["How would you feel about asking a couple of trusted people if they wouldn\u2019t mind sitting down over a coffee and giving you some constructive feedback about yourself and how they think you can grow at work?\n\nWhen they\u2019re talking with them imagine you\u2019re collecting info on someone else and you need to listen carefully and ask clarifying questions so you can be sure that you can explain it to this other person accurately. \n\nSave some time at the end and ask them to give you their thoughts on how you came across at taking the feedback.
