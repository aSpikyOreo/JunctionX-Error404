You can get a scan showing that it is either broken or it isn\u2019t. However, it is still possible to feel pain in your leg without the bone being broken. That doesn\u2019t mean the pain is fake.\n\nIn that analogy I would consider depression to be equivalent to chronic pain.

Then I understood where you're coming from. Sometimes you beat yourself up and think you should just shake it off and get your act together like everyone else. Everybody has problems right? The difference I've found is that the sheer level of energy it takes just to act normal when you're depressed, let alone focus and excel, is exhausting. Some days you can consciously push the mountain off and work towards goals. Other days man, that mountain is too fucking heavy and you're buried. Stuck.

Its not until i started meditating did I realize that depression had a much deeper root and its was an accumulation of thoughts and i lies i have said to myself. The mind is the enemy my friends, meditation is medication. Depression is a disease by accumulating thoughts of unsatisfactoriness. We all have the capacity within us to either ask for love and happiness and just as much as to give it to others. By selflessly volunteering and serving others, we can experience a much deeper sense of love and happiness that doesn\u2019t expect anything in return. That is our freedom from craving and aversion from any and all thoughts. Freedom from thoughts is happiness.", "God damn... this one...", "I understand you. Totally.

I think it might be mild or moderate depression, but I don't want to tell anyone because it doesn't sound so serious.

This was the same case with my house fire. Reminding myself of this calmed the fire some. \n\nIt\u2019s very rough losing your possessions. I lost everything I owned, with the exception of a coffee mug. Remember: things can be replaced. It\u2019s VERY hard to look for a positive, but material possessions can be replaced.

I went from calling others in the room to see if they smell smoke as well from a couple times a day to once a week. I don\u2019t think that will ever completely go away. \n\nJust do your best to remind yourself that you\u2019re safe now, and the likelihood of this happening again is super low. You survived this.

The only suggestions I can make are: give it time. It's not been that long. The trauma is still very fresh. Don't feel bad about however you feel... fire is a very violent, scary thing. Your reaction is completely normal. With you going through such an incredibly stressful ordeal, your brain needs time to process and cope with it. Keep yourself busy in the mean time with whatever you can. Talk about your feelings and cry if you need to. For sleep, I'd suggest an OTC sleep aid at a low dose or some herbal tea like chamomile or valerian. The most important thing to do is take it easy, take your time, and take care of yourself. I'm so sorry this happened to you... It's absolutely awful. But things can get better and its wonderful that you're safe in spite of the dangerous situation.

Essentially, if something really serious happens on the job (death of a child on a call, mass casualty incident etc) then the department is required to hold a CISM meeting.\n\nThe purpose of CISM is to address the traumatic event within 72 hours after it occurs. It is essentially counseling/therapy sessions to talk about and process the incident. The research behind it shows that talking about a traumatic event AS SOON AS POSSIBLE after it happens will greatly reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. \n\nTiming here is huge.

I am finally in a financial / lifestyle position that I can do things and not be exhausted financially and emotionally  (I am an introvert) I have actively looked for new friends when most of mine moved abroad or had babies. I made a point to spent time building these new friendships, made weekly recommendations of activities, joined social clubs.\n\nLike this, I have an option of 4-5-6 things to do every week but now mostly do about 2-3. The group of people and girls I go out with are all very chill and sweet, whenever there is a program we send it around the group and whoever wants to join joins. I also really enjoy the social groups (I live in London and there is a huge expat community) as they always have events going on - you can join with friends or alone, people there are always up for a chat and getting to know new people.\n\nIt takes time and practice but anything can be achieved socially! My closest / oldest friends I talk to on the phone regularly as many are moms or live abroad now and can't meet up as often.

That\u2019s really shitty. There\u2019s no excuse for this. She is rude.\n\nI visited my friend in Florida and she was a bitch the entire time, too. She\u2019s like wanna come back? I was like NOPE!", ">A friend I haven\u2019t seen in months wanted to go to DisneyWorld since she went through a break up  and just wanted to go to get her mind off of things. I agreed to go and was excited, but I found her actions while there was a bit inconsiderate.  We agreed to go out,  the night I would make it in town and i explained i would be getting in late since i have a longer commute then her and caught a late flight. She made a comment like you don\u2019t need to put on a lot a makeup or anything because i know it takes you a long time to do it, just do it at the airport or we can take pictures far away if you\u2019re worried about how you look.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>....I just jokingly explained i would be fine, but still it was  irritating  for someone to tell me what to do when we\u2019re both adults . Normally if i have time, I do a full face of makeup. However, if i know i have people waiting on me i never try to take too long, just to be considerate of their time. Anyways , When I first meet up with her at the hotel, she doesn\u2019t give me a hug or anything or seems to be excited to see me. She said she was tired. I brushed it off, we caught up afterwards and it seemed fine. As you know Disney is a lot of walking and can be exhausting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Throughout the day, she kept walking ahead of me. It bothered me a bit, but again I brushed it off. Towards the end of the day we had to take a long ride back to our hotel through a shuttle . I fell asleep during the ride and woke up before we arrived, when I get out she\u2019s already walking feet ahead of me. Doesn\u2019t say anything and just keeps walking. I\u2019m not familiar with the area and eventually lost her getting to the room. I called and texted and she didn\u2019t respond eventually I was able to figure out where the room was because I saw her through the curtain of where we were staying.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>It was annoying because not one time did she look back and attempt to walk with me , when it was completely obvious she was far away. When I eventually get to the room and walked in I said \u201cI was calling because you left me and I couldn\u2019t find the room. It would\u2019ve been considerate to walk together.\u201d  She said \u201cyou slept the whole way you should\u2019ve had enough energy to keep up.\u201d I just said no and went to shower. She fell asleep when i got out . Throughout the time we didn\u2019t bring it up again , but she continued to not walk together . It\u2019s frustrating because I took time to go to something she invited me to because she wanted to be distracted from dealing with her own personal issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Yet while I\u2019m there I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being considerate of my feelings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHey /u/ctheworld22, it looks like you posted a wall of text.
