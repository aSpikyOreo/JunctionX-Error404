In a day it is really important to have some early wins for your mental to propel you through the day. \n\nIf you wake up and your room is a mess and you get ready and leave, you will have that on your mind for the rest of the day, that mess and you have to make your bed. i suggest, every morning after your alarm goes off, get up drink a cup of water and make your bed. its simple but it will get you 3 easy wins, waking up to the alarm and not staying in bed, building discipline, making your bed which builds motivation and makes the next task that much easier, and hydrating your body after a longs night rest and waking you up so you will be more resistant to sleeping again. from there you could add waking up earlier and earlier, taking cold showers, meditation, early morning walks, reading a book( you could make yourself read if you really like coffee, make a rule, you have to read if you drink coffee, and you will read like its nothing.) from there, you need to leave your house, whether you have an occupation right now or not, you need to do something. if you do not have a job right now, go volunteer your time somewhere, like a food bank for example. if would bring you around some new faces and will get you doing something positive and find a job where you can stay productive and out of the house.\n\nnext i recommend physical exercise, running outside, inside if you have a treadmill or a local gym, if you play sports even better. keep at that. it keeps you in the moment and you can see physical improvements to your body, if you can change your fucking appearance for the better, you will realize you are changing your brain as you bring in these new habits. \n\nYou should also consider taking up hobbies that are not in a screen, play an instrument like guitar or piano etc, something where you can physically do and get lost in and see yourself improve with effort and time, this will help your mental out too, if you can improve with effort in time for that you are doing the same for your brain at the same time. \n\nDuring your time you could also do some career prospecting and training, like computer science or systemadmin type work? set up a server on a old laptop or find free resources to learn, there are a ton of books which run essentially the same as a college lab where you follow guides and they explain how everything works. maybe you are interested in another field, research it and look in your area if you could shadow someone for a week-month unpaid or paid just to see what its all about and whether you can or want to do it. \n\nNOW the most important thing is when you are with your psychiatrist you do not hold back or lie, its going to be really fucking hard, but you have to pour your fucking soul out to make real progress. if you do not hit the deep issues you will never make any real progress, and you know what im talking about because anyone feels horrible opening up to a stranger and about the worst inner thoughts and feelings at that. but you have to open the wound to heal it. \n\nThere are two sayings i live by that my father taught me, \n\nThe world will not knock on your door and ask you to come out and play, you have to get up and walk out the front door.\n\nthe second is, Love many, trust few, and always paddle your own canoe.   \n\n\nhere is advice from me\n\nif you see a target you want to reach, draw your arrow back and hard, do not let anyone sway that arrows trajectory for any reason, be right on bulls eye throughout flight through the arrow, no matter how much cross winds or gravity may fight.\n\ni live by this to not get distracted by others that may get me off my path in life. make sure to keep an eye on this for friendships and relationships, if you are looking for a girlfriend or even wife, you got to keep this perspective, are you a part of her ride/roller coaster or is she joining your ride. this is how you can get off track from what you want to achieve, if she has bad habits and tendencies that make it harder to be you like drugs or eating crappy foods and never looking to improve, and you are joining in on that, you are no longer shooting a straight arrow, you joined her ride and are coasting off your path. you need someone in your life that syncs to yourself, that inspires you to go for greatness, you want someone with a strong path of their own, one that intertwines with your own path of self development and improvement. aka if you have friends that light up all the time, and you know you shouldn't be lighting up, maybe its time to reassess your time spent with them if they are a negative influence habit wise, yeah it may be a thing you enjoy and thats fine, but thats just an example."}, {"title": "Sure it comes in waves, but every wave pushes you further out to sea", "id": "f82aoa", "body": "I got home a half an hour ago and I haven\u2019t turned on a single light.

a year before we graduated, she cheated and left me.\nshe was the lead cheerleader in our university. i supported her from her 1st day in training up until the last competetion before she left me. she met a guy during the christmas break while they are practicing to their last competetion since we are graduating students. she said, everything just clicks when shes with him, they share all interests and hobbies in life, he is like the male version of her. i tried to win her back despite of the things she did. i did everything, i seeked help with the closest of our friends, i swear i did everything, but i was too blind too see that it was too late, i guess i am no longer the reason of her smile. everyone was so shocked when they knew we separated. they cant believed what happened since they are witness to our relationship. i too cant believe she cheated on the person who will never ever cheat on her.\n\nchapter 3, the final nail, the pro me:\never since i was a kid, i've always been curious of how things work especially how technology works. since i wanted to challenge myself as always, i took the hardest engineering course available in our country. it was electronics engineering, in short, it was my dream. the college course was gruesome, only 10% in our batch graduated. the review and preparations for the licensure exam was extremely challenging. the actual field work is tiresome and demanding, theres is no room for error, everything must go well on first try.\npreparing for the final test in my career was the longest and has the most effort i've ever did in my education. it took me 2 years of hands on field work, plus 3 months of after grad review with professionals, and a month of final self review. i was dedicated, its for the best, it was my dream, i will be the first engineer in our bloodline, i can be the bread winner in my family if i pass, everything will be worth it. \nthe day came, it felt like judgement day, 3 days of written exam starting 8am and ends at 4pm each day. i have never been so focused in my life. i cant screw this up. its my chance to make a big change in my life. it usually takes 2 days before the center release the results of the exam. \nit was a tuesday, i remember having a bad feeling at work since i knew the result can be released in any time of the day. 1.30pm one of my closest friend texted me, \"congrats, i saw the results just now, you passed, i didnt know you took 2 licensure exams, you passed both you sick fuck, check the website now!\". and so i checked, he was right, i passed.\nthe final nail you ask?, let me ask you, after reading all of the things i've written above it is expected to feel somehow happy right?

This will pay off.\" Spent the last 20 years with high functioning depression and anxiety that has only worsened with age.\n\nAnd in theory. It has. I own a house. FH and I both make 6 figures separately at the age of 29. Both of us are relatively physically healthy. I've got a small circle of good friends, a caring family. FH is very loving, patient, and supportive of me. But that's about where it ends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy schedule is all over the place switching me from nights to days, and didn't give me the schedule promised. Usually work consists of dealing with at least 1-2 people who suck the life out of me. Instead of 2 weekends off a month, I have one and usually work a night shift before the weekend off so I spend most of my Saturdays asleep. Meaning I can't do anything with FH because he doesn't like to go out if he has work the next day. My days off are either spent asleep or running around in a blind panic trying to accomplish things. I work 12 hour shifts, which are typically 13-14 hours when all is said and done, so nothing gets done on the days I work. Days off that I'm awake are spent doing laundry, cleaning the house, finding the energy to cook dinner (typically we end up eating out because f\\*ck it and that requires me to have planned enough to order groceries), and taking care of our pets. Can't do anything at night because FH is a light sleeper so when he's tired, we all go to bed. Trying to squeeze in time for a dead end hobby and make it to the gym twice a week is laughable.\n\nGym is a disaster because all I have to show for it is muscle soreness and I should be going \"three times a week for results\" says dear FH who works a M-F 9-5 job and gets to go to the gym 4 times weekly. Dead end hobby is a disaster because I'm tapped out financially and emotionally and too stubborn to give up on a hobby that has become more of an identity. Can't grow into any of my hobbies because I'm afraid I'll get hurt and unable to do my job. If I can't do my job, I can't pay off my student loans.\n\nAdd to that I'm now planning a wedding. FH and family said from the get go I could do what I want. Which has turned out to be an outright lie. It's been a lot of fighting over details and having two very different visions. In addition to asking FH to keep his half of the bedroom clean, and help out with the dirty dishes, I now have to hound him for details for the wedding constantly. Anytime a task is delegated to FH he asked to be asked at least 3-4 times for it to get done; at this point, he is given the easiest, least important tasks in the house and for the wedding because I don't have the energy to keep on him.\n\nWhen I was sick for a few days, housework screeched to a halt. Nothing got done.\n\nNot to mention FH wants to start a family in the next 2 years. I spending more time dealing with suicidal ideations, looking at my 20s wasted in school for absolutely nothing, and just want to exist. I've been out of school and making more than minimum wage for 1.5 years and now I'm supposed to give everything up for a f\\*cking kid. Told FH I have goals that need to be met first before I even attempt getting pregnant, but whatever, doesn't stop him from mentioning it every time he sees a baby. And forget about sex. Most tedious, unenjoyable thing of my existence. Too tired and too little time to take care of the trainwreck of a body I have. Hate the way I look in clothes, let alone naked.\n\nAdd into that both of our families have a history of severe mental health issues but sure, why not pop out a kid?\n\nTo add to it, I feel like I'm a terrible partner because I am so selfishly, inwardly focused. I'm focused for survival, but still so self-absorbed with my own happiness that FH really has to fend for himself at all times because I am only ever available emotionally or physically to him on my own terms.\n\nIt's not getting better and at this point, I don't know that it will ever get better. I feel like I've spent the last 10 years lying to myself that it will be better. I can't keep promising myself that it will get better because I know it's a lie. I can't tell you the last time I enjoyed myself. I do know the last time I wasn't full of rage or wishing for death was at least 20 years ago.

I'm in a really dark place, I slowly feel myself deteriorating and I haven't been able to talk to someone about how the past few months have been in full detail, mostly because I'm ashamed that something so trivial could put me in a spot like this.\n\nAround 5 months ago, the girl who I'm still madly in love with and I broke up. I loved her like no other, she was everything I ever wanted. We had so many plans for the future and there were so many things that we had yet to experience together. What was the most beautiful relationship of my life was cut short due to my stupidity. She was the one to end things and I can't blame her one bit, as I fucked up. \n\nThe breakup was heart breaking. During the time that led to all this, and after, (and I can only see it in hindsight), I had been so immature that she could hardly look at my face anymore. As much as it hurt that my relationship ended, the manner in which it had to end was very degrading and hurts just as much.\n\nAfter the breakup, I slowly isolated myself from my friends and family. I started going on long walks every day at night, usually for hours, smoking one cigarette after another. I couldn't find solace in anything so I filled that hole with drugs (mostly weed, but excessive amounts, and benzos here and there). I was once a very social, outgoing, happy and confident person - now that person is gone, I have no desire left to do anything anymore.\n\nFor the past 2-3 months, I've been doing nothing but smoking an unhealthy amount (a pack of cigarettes a day, several grams of weed every week). I do nothing at all, as soon as I'm done doing the bare minimum for university, I roll a joint and play video games, as I find that this is the only time I can suppress my thoughts. I don't go out with friends anymore, and my relationships have been deteriorating. As for work or studying, I find that as soon as I do something where I have to focus, my mind drifts back to my ex, what could've been, what I did wrong, and fantasizing about ridiculous scenarios of me and her.\n\nThe cigarettes, more than anything, have been a coping mechanism for me. Smoking late at night, on walks, all alone on the streets with nothing but my thoughts. I find that without this, and without the weed, I get so anxious that it's hard for me to get through the day.\n\nMy sleeping schedule is fucked. My room is a mess. My finances are in a terrible situation. My grades are dropping and I'm at serious risk of failing the year. I can tell that my health is deteriorating, and you can even tell from my appearance. I am (or was) an attractive guy, and was told so often by strangers. Now, I have developed very visible dark circles under my eyes, I have lost a serious amount of weight so I'm starting to look like a twig, and my face has become so pale that one would think that I was suffering from a disease. A friend that hadn't seen me in a while couldn't believe it when he saw me.\n\nI truly had a great life and was excited for the future only a few months ago. Now, all I can think is, \"why even bother? you fucked up the one thing in life you cared the most about\". I can't even hold a relationship anymore - I started seeing a very pretty and nice girl, but I could not stop thinking about my ex every time I saw her. I would think about my ex when I had sex with this girl. So I had to end it with her. I am clearly having obsessive thoughts and I can't seem to stop it.\n\nI thought after a few months, things would get better. But the more I isolated myself, the more I neglected my responsibilities, the more I stopped caring about the future, I found myself being even more depressed. It's a spiral and it's only getting worse. I really don't know what my end will be. I'm 21 years old and I already think I've fucked up beyond repair. All I want is to feel normal again, it's like I'm stuck in my own mind with thoughts that I cannot escape. I feel like every moment, I could just start crying.\n\nAnd all this over a breakup. Even if she was the love of my life, I can't believe I let a girl fuck up my head so much. I've been with other girls before her and nobody affected me even remotely close to how she did. I want to fix my life, and get over her, but I don't even know where to start.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you.

I went sailing with my class, had a seasickness episode that basically never went away: here came the \"Mal de Debarquement Syndrome\". I started developing anxiety in the first few months, as I had intense nausea which prevented me from going to school for 2 weeks straight. Once I returned, nothing was the same: I still had nausea (but not as intense, which is why I was back), and ever since that day, I was never able to feel \"normal\" (aka with no symptoms, no nausea, no vertigo, no anxiety, able to sleep correctly) again.\n\nFast forward a few months: Developed new symptoms, such as short term memory issues, brain fog, equilibrium issues, Had my first panic attack, thought I was having a stroke after my first migraine episode which can apparently be a symptom of that disease. My anxiety only got worse from that point onwards, and I started getting \"disconnected\" from reality. I always feel like I'm in a dream, or that my body is numb.\n\n2 weeks ago, I started believing I was in \"remission\" because my symptoms suddenly went away. Since Friday, they're back. And my anxiety rose up with them. I have to do a brain MRI and I keep thinking they're going to find some kind of tumor, or that I have some kind of vascularization problem, stuff like that. I'm just being extremely anxious about my health due to all of the various shit that's happening to me. I'm literally lost. I don't know what to do, nor who to see.

She assured me that everything I experienced was normal, and that no matter how much it felt like it, I wasn\u2019t dying. Hearing her say all of that was very reassuring to me. Now that I know what to expect, I\u2019ll hopefully have a better handle on it next time it comes around. \n\nI know what you\u2019re going through is tough, but find some comfort in the fact that all of your symptoms point to anxiety and nothing else.

Last year was particularly difficult for me - depression and anxiety, getting married and separated within the same year. I seeked help from my friends quite a lot and later on got on to my own feet. We had our good times but sometimes I couldn't tell if she was genuine or not.\n\nI don't want to tell too many details but I'll just put it this way: My friend did something (nothing big) which I didn't like and I mentioned it. I wasn't even mad, just a bit disappointed. It was okay and she apologized. However, foolish me, I didn't answer to her apology right away and she assumed I was angry. She started to belittle the whole thing and sounded a bit irritated. I asked her to calm down (a big mistake) and that I just didn't had time to answer. And she lost it completely. \n\nShe started pointing out all the things she finds bad in me and would not stop whatever I told her. I have grown quite a lot during last year and thanks to my 2 years in therapy I know myself much better nowadays. I didn't recognize myself from the accusations she did but she insisted I was just blind. In her words I only cared about my own problems and I'm too sensitive about everything. What I recall, I've always listened to her too and I have many close friends. I admit being stuck on my own anxiety for quite a lot during difficult times (depression makes you a bit self-centered) but not even once she has said anything that would indicate she was fed up with me. She even said I ruined her party by crying (I had a panic attack). I felt betrayed. Even she has/has had anxiety and depression herself she seemed to be completely unable to feel empathy for me.\n\nWe always shared everything and I would have never thought that she would use it against me. She started a martyr act after I told her my point of view and the ways she had acted during last year (I had put up with a lot of her shit too). I was so confused why bring all those things up now. None of the things were done with any ill intentions and like the thing that started the whole fight, most of it was a misunderstanding and she reading too much into my behavior/words. Nothing that I would have started a fight about with a risk of 'breaking-up'. That's another thing: it felt like we are in a relationship rather than a friendship. She kept putting words into my mouth and there was nothing that would satisfy her. I told her I didn't see her trying to fix anything or discuss, just justify making me a bad guy and cutting ties. Forcing me to see my \"flaws\" but completely refusing to look at the mirror and reflect. \n\nLuckily I have very supportive and understanding people in my life so I know I'm not alone. And I let them know all the time how much they mean to me. But this incident has made me a bit paranoid. What if someone else has been hiding a grudge against me?

If you have your own similar experiences or advice it\u2019s totally welcome, but not required. This might get long, so bear with me.\n\nI started struggling with mild depression when I was 12/13, but I didn\u2019t begin experiencing anxiety until I was about 17. My grandmother died suddenly at a relatively young age, so most of my anxiety was around death, especially fear that my loved ones would die suddenly. This was mostly mild - I never experienced a panic attack and it didn\u2019t dramatically disrupt my life, and as time went on it got better. During my junior year of college my grandfather died, but he had been sick for a while so his death wasn\u2019t a surprise like my grandmother\u2019s so it didn\u2019t bring up any anxiety. However, a few months after this happened, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the mortality anxiety came back worse (note: she\u2019s cancer-free now and doing well). It began once again as fear of my loved ones dying, but it quickly morphed into being afraid that I would die or get seriously sick unexpectedly. I\u2019ve definitely experienced hypochondria, especially in recent months as my generalized anxiety has worsened. Still, I\u2019ve never experienced a full-blown panic attack (knock on wood), but I did come pretty close once where my chest and throat tightened up and I felt a tingling sensation in my neck and jaw.\n\nMy mental health really went down the drain after a few things. First, I graduated from college and moved back home to live with my parents while attending graduate school. I\u2019m very fortunate to be able to live at home while getting this degree, but I miss the independence I had while away from home in undergrad. I went from living in an apartment with my best friends to being home with my parents, and it\u2019s been a tough transition. Second, grad school is hard! The first semester was a big learning experience and it was really overwhelming. Third, I commute over 2 hours everyday to and from school, and it\u2019s mentally and physically exhausting (and expensive!!). Fourth, I started working at my school during my second semester. Even though it\u2019s a pretty low-key job, commuting and going to school and work was exhausting for the first few months. Fifth, my sister experienced a traumatic event, and her own mental health got really bad. I worry about her a lot and she has a long history of pretty serious anxiety, depression, and bipolar II.\n\nMy sister has always required more attention because of her long-standing mental health issues, which have been present since her early childhood. Right now because of the trauma she experienced, she\u2019s been going to two different therapists (one of which is out-of-network). My mom (who also has anxiety and depression which has worsened over the last year) is also in two different types of therapy (one-on-one and group). My parents pay for my sister\u2019s therapy, and I know that it plus my mom\u2019s therapy is very expensive. I think it might be causing money problems - my mom expresses concern to my dad about money and even though it sounded like it\u2019s under control, it still doesn\u2019t seem great.\n\nI\u2019m frustrated that my mom openly expresses worry about how expensive her and my sister\u2019s therapy is. A few months ago I was put on antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, and my mom is aware of this and has acknowledged that I should return to therapy (I went in undergrad for a few months after her cancer diagnosis). Her comments about how much money they spend on therapy make me not want to go because I don\u2019t want my parents to go into deep debt because of it. I think if I went to them saying I wanted to look for a therapist they\u2019d agree to it, but I can\u2019t help but think that in this hierarchy of \u201cwho needs help the most\u201d I would be seen as needing it the least, so if it really became unsustainable I would probably be the one to get less sessions or not be able to go at all.\n\nMy mental health has never been taken as seriously as my sister\u2019s or my mom\u2019s because mine hasn\u2019t been a life-long struggle (which again I know I\u2019m lucky). I remember when I first really struggled with depression at 12/13 and thinking my mom would be understanding because she was pretty open about her own issues and I had seen that my sister received help, but I was met with frustration and I was made to feel like an inconvenience. I\u2019ve always felt like I have to make myself as small as possible so that my parents can focus on \u201creal\u201d problems, now being my sister\u2019s mental health. Not only do I not feel like I can talk to either of my parents, but I don\u2019t feel like I can go to therapy even though I definitely need it.\n\nI feel so trapped and I have no one to talk to. I feel like I have to suffer alone because the other people in my life have bigger things to worry about, and I\u2019ve never been seen as a priority (that\u2019s what being the self-sufficient \u201cmature\u201d child does).

When I look at the big picture it feels like anxiety\u2019s been affecting every aspect of my life and controlling my every decision. I always think about what could go wrong, why it could wrong, how it can go wrong and how to avoid it which is usually avoiding the situation as a whole. This would consist of me backing out of plans with friends, backing out of school activities (I got the opportunity to go to italy with the school and already signed everything but chickened out). \n\nI have the mentality that everyone I meet already hates me. Or people who I\u2019ve never spoken to, but see everyday in my classes, secretly hate me. This causes me to get a huge bundle of anxiety in my chest whenever I finally come to speak to them one day. An example was this week I was forced to speak to a person who I see as above me and was way out of my league (not just romantically but simply as a friend) and no they weren\u2019t even the popular type of person. They seem genuinely nice but too good of a person to be my friend. I don\u2019t know why I do this to myself. I feel so much embarrassment because I have a default of thinking everyone is better than me no matter what and it\u2019s weird if I do something but normal if someone else does the same. \n\nSometimes I can feel my hands trembling and it\u2019s so difficult to control myself. I once had to do a talk in front of my class and ended up crying in the morning before school. It was horrible. Public speaking is not my thing at all. Just thinking about it right now is making my breathing shallow. \n\nJust existing makes me anxious. What do I do with myself? I can\u2019t be normal. I feel bad for anyone who has to be my friend. I feel worthless and boring next to them. I have no personality and I can hardly form comprehensible sentences without stumbling and stuttering. \n\nI always have these thoughts at the back of my mind. Even around my parents. I wonder if they think I was actually worth having (they once said they were hoping for a boy but I turned out as a girl). I know they probably love me but I feel like they don\u2019t speak to me as much as parents should to their children. I have two older sister (both waaaay older, 10 and 12 years older than me) who consistently leave me out of their conversations and ignore my presence even when I try to join in. Well, that was in the past. I don\u2019t try to join in anymore because it hurts too much whenever I get rejected. It makes me feel worthless. I know they don\u2019t mean harm but I was child. I wanted someone to talk to as well. I never ever had friends over. I still haven\u2019t had friends over to this day. I\u2019m too anxious of what they will think. I\u2019m scared they will think I\u2019m even more boring than I already am. \n\nGod, I\u2019m tearing up writing this. I really thought I was getting better but one wrong things sets me off track.

I will appreciate it so much.", "score": 3, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "best_comment": "> I have the mentality that everyone I meet already hates me\n\nWhen you meet somebody new do you automatically hate them? Why would you? Chances are almost nobody automatically hates anybody they meet. Anxiety just frantically searches for signs of disapproval even if they are not there. When a conversation is over it then hyper analyse everything in painful detail which results in the encounter seeming worse than it actually was. I don't believe anybody is worthless either, you're equally as important as anybody else and other people are not above you.\n\nHave you spoken to a doctor and been referred for treatment such as CBT? Maybe medication? The key is to challenge the thoughts and avoiding situations simply reinforces anxious feelings making it even harder next time. There are a range of self help guides and worksheets for anxiety which might help (NHS has a few helpful resources IMO). Something like meditation or breathing exercises could be helpful to. It's a tough thing to tackle for sure though it is possible.\n\nOh and public speaking sucks, I hate it with a passion. Just thinking about it makes my heart go and I'd be terrified of doing it again.

Of course I wouldn\u2019t hate someone off the bat so I guess my logic is very flawed indeed... oops. I\u2019m just not very confident in myself and I\u2019m afraid of what will come next. What if I say the wrong thing (it\u2019s happened before) or do something offensive. Nowadays I\u2019m trying to accept that it\u2019s okay to make mistakes but I can\u2019t help dwelling over them and getting myself worked up. Sometimes I just sit and imagine all the different ways it could\u2019ve gone that wouldn\u2019t have been so embarrassing. \n\nAnd I often feel like some friendships won\u2019t go well because I find it so hard to trust someone. In the past I have vivid memories of being betrayed by people who I trusted the most. Now I\u2019m afraid of fully trusting someone no matter how much they tell me I can trust them. \n\nI haven\u2019t ever brought this up with anyone, not even family. I mean I\u2019ve vaguely tossed it around in conversation but never outright put it out there and revealed how much my nerves were actually affecting my daily life. I spoke about things in a way that made it seem like it was all part of growing up and experiencing new things, most people get nervous at some point so that\u2019s most likely how my family perceived it. Again, I\u2019m too reserved to talk about my feelings in depth like I am now. It feels like I\u2019m over exaggerating and being a drama queen when I\u2019m reality I know I should be way more confident than this. \n\nThis may sound kind of strange but in a way I feel like some of my behaviours are learned. My sister was mentally ill for years and years and would never go out the house. I grew up thinking it was normal. Thinking that that was how every kid lived their life after school, being cooped up in my room or something. So I lived my life that way as well until my friends would constantly make plans to do things or I would hear people talk about their weekends that were so so eventful unlike mines.

Either in the form of yelling at me and not the other student, or somehow me getting in trouble for it. This was mostly noticeable as a kid, but there was a recent-ish (last summer) event that re-triggered it. This is MORE humiliating as an adult, mind you.  I was taking a class with a particularly bad professor and I did notice he showed a lot of favoritism towards some students (although I did manage to make an A in the class)....when there was someone asking a question and he was fumbling around, other students were talking and my neighbor asked me a question. I responded in a note and they couldn't understand my handwriting and asked me again whispering so I whispered it to them back...and the professor, in front of EVERYBODY, gave the loudest, longest  \"SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\"  to me. I know for a fact that everyone noticed. I wanted to go home and cry. I couldn't even focus on my work when I got back because it was replaying in my head.

Throughout my childhood I felt sad about the fact that me and my brother were so close agewise, yet so far apart in our relationship. Due to my brother's lack of social interest and different way of behaving, we never really bonded and have never had a real friendship. Our talks are\b always short (a few sentences exchanged) and mostly about movies, which is pretty much the only common interest we share.\n\nNow that my brother has become more mature, I feel like he is really making an effort to strike up conversations and interacting more socially. This has moved me and I have found a new love for my brother, as I feel like he actually cares about our relationship. I am trying to build a relationship to my brother, but I know that social interacting can be difficult for people with autism. So my question is, how can I develop a better relationship with him? I feel sad for him sometime since he has no friends or girlfriend and he has dealt with some depression. Over the last few years I have really enjoyed being with him, since he seems to be more interested and not just aloof on his computer like he used to. I have invited him to the movies and bowling sometimes and this is a activity that we enjoy, since we don't need to hold a conversation and can just enjoy the activity together. How can I know if my brother likes doing these things, or if he would perhaps rather be alone (since social interaction is difficult) or should I keep trying to bond and develop a friendship? If so how do I make this enjoyable for him?", "score": 7, "subreddit": "autism", "best_comment": "I think you sound amazingly supportive. I'm ASC and didn't 'flower' until I was maybe 24/25 - you seem to be doing all of the right things, as in going to the same (familiar and predictable) places to bond and share time together.

If he goes to these places with you, he is probably happy to do so - even if he doesn't show you.\n\nThe other option is to ask him outright, in a crystal clear manner (say what you mean and mean what you say!) something along the lines of \"I would like to establish a better relationship with you.

This was the same case with my house fire. Reminding myself of this calmed the fire some. \n\nIt\u2019s very rough losing your possessions. I lost everything I owned, with the exception of a coffee mug. Remember: things can be replaced. It\u2019s VERY hard to look for a positive, but material possessions can be replaced.

They slept over at my house, and left the following morning. It turned out that my mate had left her phone charger, and she told me that Sunday. I forgot to message her back. The following Tuesday she asked if I'd be in the following Wednesday, and I genuinely didn't see her message, my fault again. That Thursday, she came into my work. I work as till and stock (frontline) staff at a frozen foods store. I saw her and said hi, where she in a serious voice (but obviously to me joking) she started saying she's gonna kill me, and how she's gonna kill me, and where's her phone charger etc. I already feel embarrassed now, and she's following me around while I'm trying to do stock so I go into the back, near the back door, to get rid of some cardboard. She's still saying the same things through the back door, and my supervisor came out to see what was going on; I purposefully talk back to her in a laughy but serious way saying, \"Okay --- I'll talk to you later, I'm at work.\" where my supervisor nods and walks away. She leaves saying, \"I have to get some shopping done anyway.\" I need to keep doing stock so I go back out and she sees me again and goes, \"What's wrong with your phone? I've sent you non-stop messages and calls!\" I lied and said my phone was dead which got some comments, and then I kept working. I got called to the till a few minutes later where she is second in the que. I forgot about the rule where you can't serve friends or family and so she was trying to talk to me while I'm serving the customer infront of her. I noticed that the current customer was getting pretty annoyed, so I said to my mate, \"One sec ---- let me serve this customer.\" She goes quiet and lets me. This annoys the customer behind her, but it settled the one I was serving.   \nI get around to my mate who instantly starts drilling me again, and says suddenly, \"What are you doing tomorrow? I finish at 2, you can get my charger to me then.\" which did annoy me, so I just seriously said (in a calm voice) \"I'll talk to you later ----. I'm at work.\" She continues until she's out the door and I have to try and calm down the following customer who is pretty annoyed.  \n\n\nAfter work, I looked at my phone and only found the two messages (I said above) and that's it. I was a little fustrated but mainly confused, and when I left I called her. She instantly starts ranting about her charger, where I cut in and tell her how inappropriate it was for her to come into my work like that. She says something like \"how so?\" and I try to explain how serious and wrong it is for a mate to do that at their friends work, and how death threats are a serious thing while at work, and that my supervisor was concerned. She called my supervisor an idiot, so I started explaining how he isn't, because he is a team leader and it's his job to look out for the safety of his team. She said something that brushed off what I was saying, and noted that I need to get her charger to her soon. I explain that her charger isn't my responsibility, it's not my fault she left it, and it's her job to pick it up. She states that it was my other mates fault for not putting it in her bag and I did snap and say that I didn't care, the point is that she can't be like that at my work. She says that she's doesn't feel up to having this conversation so I hung up. 2/3 weeks of messages from me saying when I'm in so she can pick her stuff up and a talk on the phone that I talked about in my last post, and she came over today at 5:30. She dropped off an xmas present, and I gave her a bag of stuff that she'd left previously, including the charger, then a second bag of her xmas present. We meet up a lot, but she didn't want to carry the stuff so we never swapped gifts till today, which I don't mind but it was a weird thing for her to bring, in my head anyway.   \n\n\nWe then spent 1 and a half hours in absolute silence. An hour in, I made us drinks, and noticed that her hand was really red. She started scratching it at one point, while looking at a photo of herself and her Mum which was pretty worrying, and I accidentally said, \"I think you should get yourself counselling.\" Which is bloody rich from me, but it came out. \"I don't mean that in a dick way, but if you carry on you're gonna hit bone.\" she stayed silent so after a moment I said, \"You want a wet flannel or something for your hand?\" and she said, \"It's ok. It's gone numb now.\"   \n\n\nI turned the tv on not too long after this. My Mum came home, so I asked if she wanted to go to the shop. I needed to get Dog food, but I mainly thought she might do with some fresh air and space. She was 5 feet ahead the whole time and walking weirdly. I've known her for 3 years now and she was walking like she was a little drunk (she wasn't, she's really bad at hiding that sort of thing) but I was really worried. She was avoiding all the cracks in the path (which we kind of used to do for fun) but to the point where she was pretty much standing in the road at crossings and not noticing cars coming. When we got into the store, she dissapeared until I found her with some stuff she'd bought outside, then the same stuff happened again on the way home. Her dad eventually picked her up at 8, and she nearly forgot her bags (old and new stuff). I just got 2 messages saying thank you for the xmas presents. \n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know if her reaction was fear because of me, I don't know what was going on, and I don't know what to say to her. I went through the messages and thought about it and she's started an argument with herself and was asking me if I wanted to fix things (but I don't know what was broken?) and now she's acting like nothing has happened these last 2/3 weeks. I don't want to just say I'm out cause I'm worried about her. It reminds me of this line from a game I think that went like:  \n\n\n\"You desperately need something and I cannot give it to you. I literally do not have it.\"  \n\n\nShort version:  \nMy mate lost her charger, came into my work with joking death threats and alerted my supervisor, I called her later explaining why that's not ok, she waits 2 weeks to pick up her charger, we spend nearly 2/3 hours in silence, she starts acting strange in that time, she messages me when she gets home like everythings normal and nothing just happened.

I wanted to do that again,  but as an adult and with a woman. We got her the propper apparatus and while I felt gratified I also felt shame and embarrassment. Our sex life never recovered. But I did. I became a healthy stable person with goals and that had never happened before.\n\nI still have a fantasy about penises. Not men. Just penises. Why I don't consider myself gay or bi. I am 80% attracted to women and while I might have a fling, I do not want a relationship with a man. After the divorce, I met a some different women and they helped me to rediscover that passionate sexual animal I once was.

IE: you have some triggers and they might make you feel a certain way but they don\u2019t immediately send you into a panic attack or stop you from finishing your day. Anyway until this week I was sure I had come to terms with it. From around the age of 2 til I was 10, I was physically abused and neglected. When I was turning 10 I ran away and my neighbours had called the cops, found my mother intoxicated and drugged out. Due to Costa Rica being a mainly matriarchal society, my foreign father didnt get immediate custody and I was sent to a children\u2019s shelter for 3-4 months (got poisoned during my time there, 0/10 would not recommend) father won the legal case and I hopped on the next plane to the States to meet my father. I am  now 17 and well I receive occasional text from my mother to which I send semi-update pictures of myself but otherwise do not respond. For the last 1-2 years I realized I became a lot less paranoid about my back facing windows or doors, until last week.

Recently this week he decided to assign people to desk and form the desk in a circle against the walls of the room forming a nearly closed U for him to give his lectures, unfortunately I received desk number 27 which is on the Windowed wall which is nearly 80 window.

It all came crashing down and I can't trust who I live with and am scared I will loose my home. I can no longer afford therapy for help. I feel like all my work was pointless and anxiety is back in full force.\n\n\nThe long, and I'm sorry if I'm rambling. TL;DR is above. \n\nI had  stopped going to therapy about two months ago as I had to make a switch to a new therapist.\nI didn't have the money to do therapy again so soon,  so I instead used what I learned and finally made a plan for my life going forward. \nI applied the skills I used to help me stay in control.\nI got organized and after putting those things in motion I felt hopeful again. \n\nI live in a house with my partner, and 4 roommates. Before I left my therapist we had 3 roommates and partner was looking for a job, so we were struggling to make ends meet. He got a job, and we got an amazing roommate. Things were looking up.\nFurnace broke but we had heaters so surprisingly it wasn't the end of the world. I knew I wanted to replace it before summer so I decided to look for a part time job to do on the side. \nI didn't have money to go out, but making a plan, or a roadmap for a new career to improve my life made me feel better about the short term. Even my friends wanted to take me to Vegas in April and offered to front the bill for most of it just to see me. \nI felt like everything was finally coming together, dispite some minor stuff.\n\nI bought some free weights so I could start to get in shape along with a study plan and searching for side jobs. I also found a bunch of comics that are worth money and played DnD for the first time in my life with friends online.  This is going to sound dumb but I also opened up Pokemon Go again and it got me outside and gave me a goal and instant reward for getting into running for the first time in my life. When I'm not running I'm talking to people who I notice are also playing and it's helping me..well, be social again in a small way. \n\nFor the first time since my assault I felt... comfortable. Hopeful. In control. I was talking to people at work and smiling for the first time in forever. I got the energy to shave my \"depression beard and haircut\" off and everything.  I got a job interview too! Everything going so well...I finally was able to feel my shoulders and neck relax and my constant anxiety, this feeling of waiting for the other shoe to fall...it finally went away for the first time since last March! It was amazing! I felt healthy again.\n\nThen, just now, as I felt so good, I found out I..misinterpreted my financial situation and expenses. Again. All credit cards are denied. At least I have a way out though. It's ok.....\n\nThen the interview bombed. (I can't drive due to a past trauma, and they didn't like that even though there was nothing about driving on the job posting. It's apparently to see if I'm \"trustworthy and responsible.\")\n\n Then I got stuck on chapter 3 of my lesson plan and couldn't move forward, and finally found out that new roommate who's been amazing for my mental health...is leaving on the 10th of March because our other roommate is apparently an alcoholic and stole/ drank his special wine from a wedding. According to other roommates he's been doing this all year, including my stuff and I just didn't notice because I was...well dealing with PTSD all year from my assault last March. \n \n  So... yeah, now we have an alcoholic/theif in the house and I can't trust them.  \nI can't trust someone in my own home I've known for years and somone who was great for my mental health is going away suddenly because of that same person.\n\nIf we loose the house we have I loose the one place I finally feel safe. If we don't loose the house I have to figure out how to either A. Evict a person who's been a good friend up until now for years, or B. Learn to not feel safe even when I'm at home. C.

After seeing a doctor, I'm thinking maybe she is right.", "id": "f71fuf", "body": "Background: \n\nI'm 18. I was raped by a female friend at 12. I was later touched (through clothes) by my male best friend at 15. I dealt with the issues solo, not disclosing what happened until I was 17. Turns out, me behavior had changed at 12. Around that age my mom kept asking me if something happened or if somebody touched me.\n\nMy main complaint is not remembering sex. I remember most of it. The before, the after, and some flashes of during. I had always been able to recall most the details with my long term girlfriend. \n\nHowever, I had my first time with a guy I had known for 6 months before and I completely blacked out the memory of anal, along with the minor missing memory of other things like I normally have. I remember us starting. I remember him finishing. I did not know that we took 2 clips of it (I was fine with video, no face). I had absolutely no memory of what happened and when I watched the videos I felt nauseous because it didnt jog any details in my head. I remember right after we finished, I was thinking \"I wish he did _____.\" Turns out he did, I just didnt remember it. \n\nThat full memory blackout made me realize I need to seek professional help. It has the potential to be dangerous in the wrong situation. In the moment of penetration, I felt myself slipping, dissociation I'm assuming. I had never had that type of penetration, maybe it triggered something in me. [For clarification, there is a 0% chance that he drugged me. I didn't accept any food or drink until later that evening, both of which he also consumed.]\n\nMy secondary complaint is not feeling emotion as I should. I'm not emotional. I'm always bored. I don't deeply connect with other people. I absolutely destroyed my ex's heart. I probably went a bit too far with what I said, but she was making me mad by not accepting that I was breaking up with her. I didnt feel bad, I still dont, and I dont miss her. We were together over 8 months. She regularly stayed weekends and sometimes even full weeks. Yet when we split, I slept just fine and didnt shed a single tear. Also along the lines of emotional connection, I don't feel for my family. As bad as it sounds, I know I would be perfectly fine if any of them died. I also cut for a period of time just to feel something, because I feel numb.\n\nThe final thing, which isnt a major concern of mine, is possible childhood trauma. I dont remember much from under that age of 8. What I can recall is some questionable memories, most of which could possibly have a reasonable explanation. This is one of the blander memories, I have more that are legitimately weird for a young child to have. I remember being an unhappy kid around 6 years old. I never smiled in cheer practice or competition, I even frowned in my professional photos. Right after it was announced my team and I won a big state competition I had a breakdown. I started crying hysterically, so my coaches pulled me into a room to avoid making a scene in front of all the teams. They kept asking me \"what's wrong\" and the only thing I would say is \"I don't know.\" \n\n\"I don't know\" was my go to at 12-14 when I was asked what was bothering me, as it was clear something was up. It was my coverup saying.\n\nNow:\n\nI saw my PCP (primary care physician) today. Basically, all I told her was blocking out the middle time when I'm intimate with a partner and my second and third sentence here. I also added in that sometimes I would be reminded of something that we did and not have any recollection of it. Instantly, her face changed. She seemed worried. I later heard her mention PTSD to the office staff, in a question about my insurance coverage. When she came back into the room, she discussed some extra details. I was then handed a PTSD screening tool, which I filled out. After she reviewed my response she told be PTSD is likely causing my effects. \n\nI didnt think I had PTSD because I overcame the other effects. I used to really dislike crowds. I would tremble if someone was standing too close to me. Sex was something I wanted, but I would shake at every little intimate thing. Hand holding, kissing, sex, reciprocation, etc. All of that I defeated alone (or with a patient partner). I thought I was good. I'll find out more soon I guess.

Quick version is it's like if you hurt your ankle and know it just needs time to heal.  You do your best to stop thinking about it.  But if the pain is relentless and overwhelming you can't just use the same technique.  An ankle is like unplugging a cord.  PTSD is unplugging the whole house.  You have to, your brain isn't built to withstand that much pain for that long.  It literally injures your brain via changing the chemical makeup of it.  So you stop paying attention to everything.  My guess is intimacy isn't the only problem.  Friendships will be rough because it's hard to track how well you are doing with your friend if you are tuning out most of what's going on around you.  You'll forget things easily.  And you probably don't take care of yourself as well as you should.  Like there are things you should be doing for a better health and you just won't do them and you have no idea why.  That all plays into that lack of pattern recognition.  You don't notice things until way later than others would.\n\nYou're injured.  The \"T\" in PTSD stands for traumatic.  As in stress so traumatic it leaves a wound.  It's not just the emotions you have to conquer.  You have to rehab that injury and learn how to adjust your life around it.  It's no different than if you had a traumatic leg injury.  That leg may never work the same again, but you can learn to adjust to have a fairly happy life.  It's about learning how to do things differently and stopping the bad habits you've gotten into as forms of self medication.  Just like if you had hurt your leg.  So, using the leg as the example, you're really fighting two fights.  There's dealing with why your leg got hurt and then there's rehabbing the hurt leg.  Just because you make progress in one doesn't mean the other got solved.\n\nNot sure if this helped, just trying to explain why it might feel like you don't have it and why it felt like maybe you just got past it.  You didn't.  You just made yourself stop paying attention to all the symptoms it caused out of self preservation.  Therapy, talking to your doctor about symptoms, learning meditation, and Buddhist philosophy on pain all helped me.  Good luck and remember as you go through this that you did nothing wrong.

I kind of blacked out and started hitting and choking myself, screaming at her to just stop. But she went on and on. My aunt had to beg her to keep quiet. After this, I was put on risperidone and that helped keep my rage issues under control. During this period I tried overdosing on tylenol. Mom found out and was mad at me for having told my cousin.

There were red flags around, but I was in a very emotionally low point in my life and I ignored them. Anything for some company, right?\n\nThis is where the trigger warning comes into effect:>! He raped me, repeatedly. He wasn't violent in the sense of throwing punches, but he was aggressive and he did what he needed to do physically to get what he wanted out of me sexually.!< It was a horribly nightmarish part of my life. I often kick myself in hindsight for not leaving - I had so many opportunities to. But I know it's important to not blame myself. I'm working on getting a therapist, I have one in my sights, but I'm pretty certain I have some lingering PTSD from this time in my life.\n\nAnyway, I stayed in this relationship for 18 months. When I was 20, I started dating my now fiance. He is a wonderfully kind, loving man and we are very happy together (me a 23F and him a 28M). The current problem I am experiencing, however, is that my sexual identity has been completely stripped from me by my abusive ex-boyfriend. I love my fiance and I do find him attractive, but almost in a completely non sexual way. \n\nI don't think it's a sexual orientation thing, because my first relationship ever (as a 15F) was with my highschool boyfriend (15M) and we were very emotionally intense (\"I love you with all my heart and soul, you're my everything, we're gonna get married, I'd die for you\" etc. You know how it is at that age). I was very physically attracted to him and had no problem expressing it. The biggest problem with him was that he was controlling and a complete emotional terrorist. The good times with him were intoxicatingly good, and as hormone-ridden teenagers we fooled around a lot but we never had penetrative sex. The bad times were BAD - he'd threaten to kill himself if I left, he tried to keep me out of advanced classes because he said I wouldn't be able to handle it, he was weirdly close with all of his female friends and made me feel crazy or jealous whenever I tried to talk to him about it.\n\nThis all connects to the reason why I'm posting here, I promise.\n\nSo, to sum up, I used to healthily identify as heterosexual (or at least demisexual, in the sense that I don't usually feel attraction to someone until I develop deep feelings for them). My fiance and I haven't had any kind of successful sexual relations in over a year, and we've given up on even trying (because I panic). Our relationship is suffering, I feel immensely guilty, and I am confused about my sexual identity which is incredibly frustrating for me. I haven't felt a pure physical attraction to my fiance, or even anyone, in years and I feel like a part of me is missing.\n\nNow, I am an actor in a community theatre play. I have to kiss and \"canoodle\" my scene partner, like, 8 times in this show. Normally this wouldn't bother me, because physically romantic interactions are just so clinical for me now.\n\nHowever... I find this dude SO attractive! It's so strange, since we started working on the romance scenes, my stomach is all fluttery whenever I look at him. I keep giggling during the intimate moments on stage and I haven't even kissed him yet! I feel like I'm 15 again and holding my boyfriend's hand for the first time. As a person, he's pretty cool - nothing particularly special to me, so I'm not worried about falling in love with him or anything, I love my fiance very much and he is no doubt the only one for me. But damn, this guy is reintroducing me to my long lost sexual identity and I feel like I am somehow cheating on my fiance for simply noticing these feelings.\n\nThe next day, at my day job, a handsome young man came in for a meeting with one of my coworkers and I found myself simply admiring his physical features... I am *so* not used to looking at people like this and it's freaking me out.\n\nThe worst part is, I seem to be finding attraction in people that *aren't* my fiance. I truly am attracted to him, but it's in a loving way, a safe way, a way that makes me feel at home. There's no lust there, on my end. And I feel like a monster for it, because as a heterosexual man he has needs that I am not fulfilling at all.\n\nMaybe I've subconsciously learned to remove the love from sexual attraction, and that's possibly why I'm finding it in people that are not my fiance? I don't know. But I have all these feelings of lust and guilt and I feel like a teenager going through puberty again, which I gotta say is something I definitely do not want to revisit.\n\nI don't know how to handle this.", "score": 1, "subreddit": "ptsd", "best_comment": "While I can\u2019t read the trigger part, I would dare say that a therapist may tell you this is not uncommon.

I have felt immeasurable pity and sadness for them, but never once have I felt angry. In my situation, my ex was an unmedicated (and undiagnosed at the time) paranoid schizophrenic. Violently abusive for a year and a half. Couple of trips to intensive care and permanent damage. In fact, just on Monday night I had an epileptic fit caused by the brain damage he did. So, constant reminders of the trauma. However, at no point have I felt angry at him. The reasons for this are:\n\n\n1) He was literally ill. When he was beating me or stomping on my head, or trying to knife me in the chest, you could see in his eyes that the person he was, was just not there. When it was all over, he would suddenly return and not really know what was going on. It was so sad to see the realisation dawn to be honest.\n\n2) I could have left. I made the decision to stay because I was aware that if I was not there, then he would have literally no one and would probably top himself. I thought I was strong enough to take it and not fight back. I was wrong. That mistake was on me. Not victim blaming myself there, I just completely underestimated how awful things were going to get and then I was too far down the rabbit hole to escape.\n\n\nNo, any anger I feel is directed purely to the city I lived in at the time. To the government bodies I turned to for help, but continually did nothing. The police who, after getting a call for assistance, told me I'm a big boy and that we could sort it out between ourselves. Only to be hospitalized that night in intensive care. Or the woefully inadequate mental health teams who couldn't do anything unless he requested help and who's best advise was to barricade myself in the spare room to sleep.\n\nSo, in a long winded way, what I'm saying is, it's sometimes not possible to be angry with the abuser because of mitigating factors. Pity is very much possible. The fact that they are like that shows some awful things happened to them. Any human can feel empathy for that without excusing their actions. I would actually say that no longer feeling the anger is a good thing for you.

I also break down every task into ridiculously small tasks and set alarms so i dont forget to check the time frequently (easy for us to lose track of time) and i do my best not to get mad when i dont get all of the things done, because really anything done is a big deal for me some days. \n\nBut honestly, medication has helped me with this a lot, it makes all of my coping mechanisms easier, i can stick to the bullet journal more rigorously, and i dont get so overwhelmed when i have a lot to get done, and i can prioritize what really needs to get done more easily. \n\nHope this helps!! Just my experience, but it helped me feel less hopeless since people kept telling me i was depressed when really i felt mostly fine, just super upset that i couldnt seem to tackle anything i wanted to get done. Medication pretty quickly solved a lot of that, and made it really clear that any anxiety/depression i have is very rooted in my frustrations with misunderstood ADHD symptoms.", "second_best_comment": "This is invaluable advice and I thank you a million times over.

That is because theses things adds up, and they slowly erode the patience of the people who are close to us. After 20 years, when my mom sees the light open, she can't shrug it off anymore, she doesn't have anymore patience left, she's used it all up already. She is tired! It's unrealistic to demand endless patience from her. Having to remind me everyday theses thrivial things *is* distressing for her. It's normal blow a fuse eventually.

Right now I have a boyfriend, and he says he doesn't get annoyed when I forget to close my fridge door. All I can think about is that he's not annoyed YET, and that he will one day resent me over theses thrivial things I'm always trying so hard to change but can't somehow. It's so exhausting. I feel broken and unlovable. I feel so incredibly malfunctioning. I feel beyond repair. I'm tired of spending 90% of my energy trying not to procrastinate and remembering to close the fucking lights and do the dishes. I'm exhausted. I hate ADHD. I hate that in 20 years of life I still haven't understood how to be on time at work. I really do want to be on time, why can't I? What's wrong with me? Why am I so stubborn at not waking up, and why do I always leave last minute. I'm always stressed out. I'm always HATING the choices that I make, and who I choose to be on a daily. If only I discovered a way to successfully work on it and change who I am it wouldn't make me so depressed. But to know that I'm already giving my 100% to be the best person that I can, and that I'm still not able to show up to work on time after 20 years of life makes me want to kill myself. I'm so tired.

English is not my first language so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. Last year I got diagnosed with heavy clinical depression and social anxiety. My mental health got progressivly worse over the years and I was only able to get professional help through the support of a friend of mine.\n\nI\u00b4m 26 years old and currently studying and working part time. Even though the therapy kinda stabilize me in a way that I\u00b4ve a \"safe space\" to talk about my feelings and emotions I still dont feel any improvment. I also take anti depressants but they have no effect at all. The only reason I continue taking them is cause I dont want to deal with the withdrawal effects right now. \n\nEspecially my brain fog and focus issues are really bad and dont seem to go away no matter what. I barely function especially in my part time job where I can legit go home after 2 hours because I\\`m done with my head for the day but I still have to pass 6 more hours. I havent been able to do stuff for the uni for quite some time now.\n\nThrough some research about depression and treatments I found some articles and videos about ADHD in adults a couple of weeks ago. I was looking through alot of videos, articles, reports and also this subreddit. I can relate to many things that people deal with. I never knew that inattentive ADHD exists because it\\`s not really talked about.\n\nThe things I expierence is extreme brain fog, slow thought process, tired really fast, no focus, spacing out on tasks or conversations, procrastionation for no reason at all. Also one of the things I always found odd about me was that I always had the feeling that I expierence emotions different from other people. Really intense and sometimes to a point where they get painful. It is really hard for me to deal with those emotions when they happen. I told my therapist and psychiatrist about that but I never really had the feeling they understood what I try to explain. I saw that many others with ADHS expierence these intense emotions. \n\nI got an appointment to get myself tested for ADHD in July but it\\`s still so far away and I dont know what to do til then because nothing seems to work or to improve. Each passing day feels so wasted and painful. It\\`s hard to deal with.\n\nI simply fear that they will tell me there is nothing wrong with me and I dont have ADHD. I tend to put all my hope on those things because I just wanna know what the fuck is wrong with me and my brain. I want an answer to that since I always had the feeling something is not right in my head, The same kinda hope I had when I got my anti depressants but that didnt work out that well and actually put me down even more after realizing they dont work.

I've always known of ADHD through working with children and teenagers for a number of years. However it was only last month in early January when one of my university lecturers spoke to me about his struggles with undiagnosed ADHD until he was 43, and while everyone else was laughing at the story (his delivery was very comical), I was almost in tears because he could've very easily been describing me. All of a sudden I wondered whether all of the things I had always thought to be character flaws or negative personality traits could be explained by something else, and after reading up and doing more research I spoke to my GP and I'm now waiting on a referral to see a psychiatrist about it. The waiting list is about 5 months so I'm likely looking at July/August, so a relatively similar time frame to you.

I have insomnia, depression, anxiety, and a migraine disorder (all diagnosed by a doc) and was raised by a family where mental illnesses and disorders are Not To Be Talked About and can/should be fixed by hard work/effort, so I've been mostly in denial of this even though I've been asked by coworkers if I'm ADD for various reasons and the ADD 'tests' my partner has shown me that he got from his therapist have all shown that I also mark extremely high on the relevant symptoms list.\n\nSince I do well enough in school (and have no small amount of imposter syndrome), I also just thought I was lazy and not 'bad enough' to look for a diagnosis, and ADD-like symptoms could've been from my other issues. The few times I have mentioned ADD as a possibility to doctors/therapists, their response has been 'you're not bouncing off the walls and you have a good GPA, you don't have it\"\n\nMy partner has been entertaining the idea of me taking one of his pills (Adderall XR, about 30mg I think) to see how I react but we were always worried about the effects with my other medication and I didn't want to rid him of medication he needed. His therapist recently advised him to have some controlled weekends without the meds to avoid his body getting too used to it and that seems to have cinched the deal. So this morning after checking for known interactions I took one of his pills.\n\n**Pros:** I have been crying off and on since it kicked in because I have been able to choose to give in to my distractions. Writing this is a distraction from studying but I could push off the urge to share the experience and ask for advice on the floaty bits until I had finished other things. I can think about doing a task without a million more thoughts popping in. When I first broke down and cried it was because I realized my brain is actually *calm*. Or at least more calm than I have ever known it. I can push away distracting thoughts, I organized all of my physics notes into 'To-Do' and 'Not-To-Do' or 'High Priority' piles in *less than 10 minutes* when the thought of doing that is something I've been anxious and obsessing about for days. I'm still having other thoughts like \"the dishes need to be done\" or \"I also need to study biochemistry\" but I have actually pushed them away and I can *focus* on the one task. I haven't fidgeted to pick at my skin all day (verified this with my partner cause I do it without noticing) and I actually sat still to read an email for 20 minutes. My closet is full of crafts and scarves I made because I have never been able to sit still for any length of time and I bring knitting to class because if I'm not moving around or splitting my attention I can't listen or remember anything that happened in class (and even then my memory is shoddy). I've spent a straight 30 minutes just sitting quietly working on physics with only *one* source of background noise when normally I need two or three. I feel calm and able to focus for the first time in my life. I don't remember a time when I could ever just sit with a calm brain unless I was completely exhausted, and even then my brain is never calm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so sorry for all the small thoughts I had in moments of frustration about \"everyone's a little ADD\" or \"people just need to work harder\" or \"my partner doesn't care\". To my partner this has cemented his theory that I'm ADD and I can't ignore the difference just this tiny pill has made because whenever I notice something I do differently now to how I normally do it I start crying. Even just moving around and breathing feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I can't imagine how it is for him with much more severe ADD. Part of me still wonders if this just means I'm a faker because this one pill has completely changed today for me and things that would normally take me hours or days of obsessing over it, getting distracted by something else, and then returning to it after more obsessing/worrying have taken me a half hour or less of just 'I can do \\_\\_ now', and that's all the decision I need. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons and Questions:** I feel quite floaty and when the Adderall first kicked in I was extremely dizzy. Not sure if it's an interaction with my other meds or the fact that he is on a high dose and is larger in body mass than me. Is feeling floaty normal? Also been feeling really goddamn thirsty and no amount of drinking water has changed the dry mouth. Plus everything feels slightly different in terms of textures - really annoying/distracting/painful textures are muted and everything feels so much smoother. Is that normal? Is this how it was like when other people started Adderall? Now I'm just trying to come to terms with the fact that maybe I'm ADD...and trying to ignore the long road of diagnosis that might lie ahead of me. I'm not asking if I have it, I just want to know if this is normal for the first day on meds.\n\nApparently I am no less wordy. I know very very few of you will be able to read all of this, but any advice/answers to the questions are very much appreciated.

It wasn't until things were really stressing me in my job (a lot of organising) that I'd started half a year ago did I really feel it.\n\nAnd then about a month ago I stumbled upon \"inattentive ADHD\" and well, my jaw dropped. I've never, ever read something so relatable. I felt as if I was reading my entire life and I cried because I've always blamed myself or thought I was just a bad person overall. All the mistakes, the difficulty concentrating, the tasks I've failed the overwhelm and fear over having or organise even the most simple of things. How I'd constantly zone out when speaking to people despite loving these people or being genuinely interested. How I'll be trying to complete a simple task to find myself completely elsewhere an hour later. The procrastination that I thought was normal, that's seriously caused bad or big effects in my life. The list goes on and on.\n\nAnyway, I hate going to the doctor's for ANYTHING. But...finding out about inattentive ADHD just got a fire lit in me so a few weeks ago I went to my GP and was just..honest. thought I'd be laughed out the office or just slapped with \"anxiety\" and told to be on my way.\n\nShe did, to my surprise, refer me there and then to be assessed. I honestly then thought it would take forever to hear back. Again, more to my surprise I had a call yesterday from them and I've now booked in the assessment for a few weeks time. (Let's hope I remember despite writing it on paper, on my phone, on notes etc lol)\n\nSo it's an odd relief. The thing is, I could be wrong and it might not be ADHD. But still, going out and searching for answers feels good at least.\n\n\nSo I guess my question is, how was this process for you lovely people? Apparently it'll take an hour. Is it a checklist of sorts that you're to answer, or do you just talk to the doctor? \n\nAnd then, do you find out straight away, or are you put on another waiting list for a follow up appointment?\n\nI'm not entirely nervous but I guess having a heads up would ease me. \n\nThanks for listening.

I slept 2 hours tonight cause my anxiety is ruining me right now. \n\nTrying to keep it short, so here goes: \n\nI've been sick on and off since November. It's majorly sinus infections that just won't go away. I believe that my allergies cause some inflammation episode, but I'm starting to wonder if the stress does it too.   \nNovember is thanksgiving. I'm allergic to furry animals (not in the way where I could drop dead, I mostly get headaches, itchy and stuffy nose) and I have to visit my family for holidays.  Problem is, they have several pets (cats and dogs) that aren't necessarily well-groomed. Their fur is matted and greasy and if I pet them (cause I'm stupid and can't help myself, also animals soothe me in moments of stress) the gunk gets stuck on my hands and it sticks to anything I touch (I drank bottled water and hours later when I took a sip from the same bottle I could smell it). Family stresses me out, they're too toxic to me, but I feel obligated to go. Last year I had an anxiety attack prior to Christmas because of how badly I don't wanna go and I had just recovered from my first episode of sinus infections (despite taking allegra TWICE prior). So Christmas came, yet another stressful event and back to sinus infections after. Then I got REALLY sick (couldn't move for an entire day because EVERYTHING was sore, I couldn't even talk cause those muscles hurt) but finally recovered. A few days of stuffy nose (which is an improvement, mind you) and I wake up feeling like my face was punched. Eventually figure out it's my sinuses and it wasn't my husband accidentally sucker-punching me in the middle of the night. First one side hurts, then both. Nose gets stuffy. Can't touch or move my nose in any way because of the pain. It took a while but it went away recently. Yes, recently. It's February, and I've essentially been sick non-stop since Thanksgiving. Now the kicker is that today is a family member's birthday and I plan on calling her (too far for a visit) but I couldn't sleep from anxiety. Other family also invited themselves over for my birthday and I get snarky remarks when I tell them I'm busy (which I truly am, and they should know this...). I won't be meeting them YET, but I will eventually or else I won't get to hear the end of it. I felt off yesterday (I barely had a few days of feeling normal-ish which still means a stuffy nose) but today I just feel flat out sick, like I'm gonna develop a cold. Throat feels coated, I keep sniffling, sinuses feel swollen and I'm nauseous. Just last year I thought I could pride myself with a decent immune system because the last time I remembered getting sick was for a few weeks (thanksgiving and xmas again, duh. It didn't last months like it does this time), now it's like there's a queue of health problems that my body checks off one after another so everyone gets their turn...    \n\n\nWhat would you guys recommend for me to do?

It's an important part of growing and adapting and improving as a person. However, there is a point where the stress related to the change is too much and it becomes overwhelming and you no longer get the same benefit.\n\nThink of your social activities as a type of phobia (not saying you have a social phobia, just try this as a thought experiment). If you were afraid of snakes there are going to be situations that you're comfortable with (hanging out with mice, no snakes in sight) a little uncomfortable with but you can handle (seeing a stuff snake or a picture of one) and things that feel WAY uncomfortable and are overwhelming (seeing an actual snake). Forcing yourself to interact with a snake when you haven't yet learned how to manage less anxiety-provoking situations is just going to result in you freaking the f out and having to use other behaviors to cope. Instead, you want to practice doing the things that are slightly uncomfortable but you can manage them until they feel less uncomfortable.

As you experience stress, hone stress management tools to help provoke your relaxation response and decrease your reflexive, irrational, primal fight-or-flight response (this reflexive response is what often times drives us to want to yell or punch someone)\n   1. Meditation\n   2. Exercise\n   3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n   4. Deep Breathing (there are so many styles of breath work available) \n   5. Re-framing- shift your distorted thinking to more tangible, digestible, rational thoughts. \n      1. If you can reduce your reflexive response to stressors this is a huge win for you and the people who live with you. Now you can use your rational brain to navigate your stressful circumstances rather then yelling at someone, chasing the person down who cut you off during your morning commute, or stop you from punching any more holes in the wall.\n2. Reduce the negative effects of future stress by shifting your mindset toward optimism and resiliency through prospective shifting psychology like:\n   1. Behavioral psychology (better understand how you and other people behave)\n   2. Cognitive psychology (better understand how your brain processes info)\n   3. Acceptance Commitment Therapy (learn how to accept the truths of reality and engage in mindfulness and gratitude practices)\n      1.

Step one is to try to get your nervous system out of that mode and get into a rest/digest mode. Breath work is one of the quickest ways to deescalate your nervous system. The exercise I like most is to focus on your out-breath, trying to make it a little longer each time and pausing at the beginning and end of each breath.\n\n2) Relax. I don't mean this in a \"just chill out, man\" kind of way, but to systematically scan through your body for tension and consciously and intentionally relax the muscles that are tensed up. Most commonly, shoulders and jaws get really tense when stressed out. You can also start at the bottom, tense your feet for 5 seconds then relax. Then tense your calves for 5 seconds, relax them. Then tense your thighs for 5 seconds, relax. etc, all the way up your body.\n\n3) Do some anti-anxiety therapy exercises. When you're most stressed out, check in with your thoughts to see what the general content is and review them for accuracy. Just because you have a though, doesn't make it true. Ie, \"The world is going to end if I'm 5 minutes late\". Really? Is it? I know you know that's not really the case. So then what is the most likely consequence if you're 5 minutes late? You get dinged on your grade? The professor shoots you nasty glare? Absolutely nothing happens? And if those less than positive things DO happen, so what? Can you survive a bad grade? Can you survive a mean face?\n\n4) Ask for help. When you're feeling more calm, talk to your wife about responses that would be helpful from her when you're having a higher than average stress day. Does that mean to give you lots of space? To not bring up decisions that can be postponed? To give you a big hug and tell you that you're doing a great job?  That you need her to take on more?\n\n5) Make sure you're covering your other physical health bases as much as possible. Sleep. Eating well. Some form of movement. Your body is trying to keep up with the mental demands as much as possible so make sure you're giving it the resources it needs to handle it as best as it can.\n\n6) Ask for more help. Don't feel like you have to wait until you're at your breaking point to contact a therapist. Sometimes it can take a few weeks to get an appointment and you don't want to be going through that when you're already maxed out.

I don't know if this is the right sub-reddit. If it is please correct me.\n\nLet's go back to September 2019, I had begun feeling slightly depressed and had no motivation at all. My grades went from 70s-80s average to 40s-55s average. Only class I did well in was  Business because it was the only class which I was interested. On the second day of my school year, I met a new friend. We'll call him Jax. Now Jax changed everything. He was and still is my brother from another mother. Fast forward 3 months and he leaves back to the US. He was here on a foreign exchange program. When he left everything returned. I began feeling depressed, anxious and stressed as fuck. Not to mention my exams which were to happen in 2 weeks. I didn't give a shit about them anyways and we had a school trip to Geneva, Switzerland and this trip was everything. It was amazing. I return to the school after a week, and exams began the week after. I failed science, had a terrible report card and my mom was embarrassed of me and called me a disappointment and even went as far to threatening to kick me out. She ended up destroying my PC which i built as a birthday present, and video games was my escape to everything. I got my shit together out of fear and started feeling even more depressed and my stress levels were high af.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward I got better grades, and here come my second exams.

Now I failed 2 exams and I wasn't planning to tell my mom at all. She squeezed them out of me of course. She ended up grounding me un-till June as that's when my IGCSE exams finish. She took all of my money which stressed me out even more because I got that as a birthday present and I was going to save that up to run away once I'm 18 and it was a decent sum. I can't talk to friends. My routine is I wake up, go to school, come home, study. Yesterday, I was supposed to finish 2 tasks and I had 1 h and 30 min to do so. I took 2 h and 30 min and my mom got mad and started on about how I won't get into Uni with these grades. She even said that she'll only let me leave if I get into a Uni that is ranked within the top 75 globally. I'm sick of her shit, I'm completely different compared to her dream child and my little demonic sister is her favorite child. Sometimes I sit in the shower for an hour just thinking about life and how I'm gonna leave this shit but I can't. I end up punching the wall in the shower.

I know that tests can get stressful and having a low grade really blows, and I\u2019m sorry your going through it right now. Something one of professors told me was if you want to be a good engineer you have to be persistent and arrogant. This really stuck with me and I apply it too many of my day to day activities. Studying is like any other problem in engineering, you have to problem solve, and sometimes be a little cocky about it. When it\u2019s time to study, get cocky about it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the whole shibang before of having a \u201cI can do this attitude\u201d, but it makes all the difference. I thought it was cheesy when I first heard it and still do, but I can statements are, in my opinion, very impersonal. I would never say something like \u201cI can pass this test\u201d, I say more personalized things, in my head, too myself that I would actually say like: \u201cIma get this sh*t down!\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s get study lit in tha hizzzzzzaaaaach!\u201d, or \u201cima bouta make this study sesh my b*tch!\u201d.

I get amped by saying such phases as the ones above, listening to amp music(Ex:7Nation Army-White Stripes, Middle Child-J.Cole,Bulls on Parade-Rage Against The Machines), or even walking faster then I normally would while mentally amping myself. Another way of problem solving is to start identifying where your getting low marks on your test from. For me, it\u2019s a lot of little things I get wrong, and basic things that I skipped more over for the harder parts. Another thing to do is whenever you get confused by something in class make sure too set a reminder in your phone to visit office hours. Get to know your professors, many of them are very wise and very fun people too know(also being on your teachers good side is never a bad thing). Make sure to stay proactive: know when tests are, know when homework is due, and go to class.

I hope that someone in the community can correct me if I am wrong here but I believe the exact number to provoke a relaxation response is six, not one.\n\nNow what is more interesting here is the details of the breath. Your inhale actually stimulates your sympathetic nervous system (an energizing response) while your exhale stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system (the relaxation response).\n\nAnd finally, if you are trying to turn on your relaxation response you to make sure you are taking deep slow breathes from your diaphragm. There are many styles of deep breathing types but I think 6 breathes per minute or an inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds is a pretty standard protocol. \n\nSo in short, 6 breathes, breathe from your diaphragm and focus on a long, low, deep exhale.", "second_best_comment": "The original \"relaxation response\" by Dr. Herbert Benson (I think written in the 70s) said to give yourself about 10-20 minutes of breathing. This wasn't necessarily in response to acute stress, but as a daily practice to improve your ability to respond to stress.\n\nI heard in a workshop on trauma (but can't confirm because apparently I didn't write it down), that the initial surge of adrenaline in a stress response lasts for less than a minute before cortisol takes over. If you can intervene immediately after the stress response, you can prevent the cortisol spike from happening. That's more timeline vs, duration though.\n\nPersonally, I can feel a difference in about 60 seconds, but I've also been practicing for awhile. Prior to going to the doctor's office or anywhere I'd need to get my BP taken, I'd do some breathing exercises for a minute or so (sometimes less, the length of time for the cuff to puff up), and I could have a fairly significant effect on lowering it. Granted a lowered BP doesn't necessarily indicate that you're out of the stress response, but at least subjectively I feel more relaxed.\n\nIf I have trouble sleeping at night, I can usually get my body into a relaxed, sleep-ready state in less than 5 minutes. \n\nI don't so much count breaths as just focus on the breathing itself, particularly the exhale, pausing at the top and bottom of each breath for a moment. \n\nYou're right that most articles on breathing/stress response don't like listing times/duration which can be frustrating.

I have always had anxiety issues, so I have been an evening marijuana user for approx. 8 years to wind down and help me sleep. This stress has recently turned into depression ~9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us, \u201cbecause of me\u201d. It was then I started to notice new, troubling acute and intermittent symptoms, like brain fog, poor concentration, NO libido, inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively, extreme fatigue, no appetite, no strength, high BP/racing heart, weakness, to name a few. 4 days ago, I experienced what I believed to be a mini stroke - although I was \u201calert\u201d, I felt very disoriented, couldn\u2019t talk normally, felt confused, off balance, numbness in hands, felt like I was gliding rather than walking. After a couple of hours, I eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed, as I simply just did not want to commit myself to ED if it was not 100% necessary (I know that wasn\u2019t the best option in that moment, however I felt for me it was.) Neuro exam review was \u201cfine\u201d they said, and she said I likely had an inner ear infection, and gave me Antivert and said to follow up with PCP. Me knowing my history, I was not sold on that diagnosis, but felt fine enough to accept it. Today I followed up with my PCP whom I\u2019ve been with for 10 years. She agreed that it likely wasnt an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms, so I have an MRI ordered and will be going tomorrow. \n\nI actually work in the medical field, specifically mental health and addiction, so I am very well aware that my stress/anxiety/depression/MJ use are likely the reason for my issues. I am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this stroke-like incident. Has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good? \n\nI know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where I am today. A few weeks ago (prior to the \u201cstroke\u201d incident), I was certain I had MS due to all my progressive symptoms, yet knowing deep down the real, most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that, but the only missing symptom was a stroke- then bam!

Work related stress I used to handle like a champ, but now I\u2019m falling behind at work and unable to catch up. If things keep going this way, I will eventually lose my job; or worse, my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me. My mood is just emotionless.

All following  a pretty rough breakup. Stressed beyond belief and its starting to wear on me. \n\nTo start off on a good(ish) note. I just graduated college with my Bachelors degree in 2 1/2 years. This is good and bad. If anyone is in college and rushing through like I was/am this post may be important for you to hear. Anyway, when you graduated that quickly in my field of study you don\u2019t get to enjoy the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. I graduated having never gone to a party, drinking, or much else socially. I went to classes, did my homework, and joined a club or two that were all related to my studies. \n\nUpon graduating, actually sitting at my graduation I realized that there was no gratification for rushing through college. No reason. Life will wait for you in some cases and this is one. I graduated with maybe only 2 or 3 people I would consider to be friends.

Then I have to book it out at 4:30 so that I can have time to do my homework. I come home and do homework for 4-6 hours and then if I can, I try to go to the gym so that I at least get a little exercise in. Then by that time I have to get home and get straight to bed so I can do it again in the morning. \n\nIm so incredibly stressed and its wearing on me.

While living with **depression** can often increase the risk of clutter, studies have shown that the more clutter you are surround in, the more stressful an experience you will have. Living and working in a clean environment is a surefire way to begin eliminating stress from your life. Whether it\u2019s just tidying up more regularly or doing a major overhaul of your clutter, the moral of the story is the same. Less mess equals less **stress**. \n\nIt can be frustrating for many to keep up on household tasks. This is especially true for people who live with others and have varying standards of **cleanliness**. A good way to address this issue is to assign those you live with specific tasks that you can work on so that the **stress** of cleaning up after others is eliminated as well as the messes themselves. \n\nIf you find that you are struggling with people who don\u2019t want to help you keep your environment clean, sometimes the best way to handle it is to take responsibility for yourself and yourself only. Clean your own dishes, do your own laundry, and claim a space for yourself that you can easily maintain without the interference of others. This will help you to wash your hands of a problem that can sometimes seem to have no solution. \n\nIf you find it difficult to keep up on household duties and maintaining a clutter free environment, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not alone. You could very easily begin to improve. Take small steps at first in putting a system in place that you can maintain. If things are bad, start one room at a time until completion and have a plan ready to keep it maintained. Set rules for yourself using charts and planners and alarm reminders so you know that on a certain day you will be dusting and doing regular household upkeep.\n\nOnce everything is deep cleaned, then maintaining that standard can be as little as ten minutes per day if you break it up into a routine. Then once a month you can begin to do a deep clean so it gets easier and easier to stay on top of the clutter. \n\nEverything can benefit from having a good system in place. This can be especially true for motivated and busy people. If you are having a hard time juggling your responsibilities and tend to put cleaning at the bottom of the list, you\u2019re not alone.

I go to an IB (International Baccalaureate) school. They are typically known for being extremely high demanding and performance driven, or at least mine is. \n\nEver since the first day we started getting grades in school I have always loved getting good grades, being a high achieving student became  one of my main priorities in life. Living up to the expectations I had on myself has been the center of my life ever since then. For the most part have I really really enjoyed it. That rush and adrenaline kick I would get when receiving a test paper or the e-mail with the grade for an essay I have written. I lived for these \"highs \" I guess you could call them.\n\nDue to this I have always worked way above the pressure and expectations anyone should have on themselves. Meaning that anytime that I have gotten a B+ or anything below that would completely ruin me for days on end. Because of this stress has been something that I have tried to cope with for I don't know how long. Always expecting myself to perform above and beyond has in a sense taken a toll on me emotionally, physically and mentally. But even though this would I continue to push myself.

And by everything, I mean E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. I started lacking energy when sitting in class. I Began to isolate myself from friends and struggling to pay attention even when I was interested. My teachers have a tendency to ask students who are not paying attention if they are not only physically present but also mentally present. Which is really how I feel, my body is 100% in school  but my brain is somewhere in the clouds waiting for the torment which is called \"school\" to just be over. This has now become my everyday life. I went from a student which had plans and motivation to achieve something. To someone who hates to realize that any day that isn't a weekend or a day off, is just another day lost to to pure sadness and despise. I have started hating life, wanting to just disappear and escape all the work and expectations which seems to constantly chase me. What I am getting at is that I feel like there are these never ending expectations on me which I can't seem to satisfy no matter how hard I work.\n\nMy life has become hell which seems to never end.

Those being graded on \"quality\", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an \"A\".\n\nWell, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.

Using meditation apps may help here. Taking a walk may help here. (You don\u2019t really need a gym membership to take a walk. Just do it). - Others may reccommend many other things which have helped them. It may help you too but only you can determine that.\n\nThe other thing \u201cstress management\u201d can mean is that you do something to change the environment so it becomes \u201ccopable\u201d for your brain (and then also for your body). - This means that you change the circumstances of your current life situation so you are no longer in an environment your brain cannot cope with. - This can be things like moving to somewhere else, changing job (maybe even from one type of job to a completely different type). It can be an\u00fdthing, but only you can tell what it has to be in your case.\n\nYou are carrying an expert on stress with you all the time. - Your stomach! - If you really listen to what it tells you (look closely, deep down there), then your stomach knows quite clearly what is wrong. - Often though we do not really like to do what the stomach tells us is necessary. Don\u2019t make that mistake. The stomach knows best.\n\nIf there are many confusing things and many potential problems around you or things you have to consider or do all the time, then there is a simple thing which might help: Write it down! All of it, so it does not have to stay in your head. When it is on paper you can put it away and take it back and look at it. One item at a time. You can then prioritize and see what is really big or small or what is interconnected.\n\nWhen we write things down we often start at the top left of a piece of paper and move on down to the lower right corner. Or we make bullet point lists. - But do not do it that way. Because the \"organizing\" will limit your brains attempt to put \"everything\" from the head down to the paper. Instead you should take a big piece of paper (like A3 /double letter) and just \"spray\" the short notes down totally random on that paper. With absolutely no attempt to organize as you \"download\" your brain to the paper. This way you will be able to get it all down with out the brain blocking for \"output\" because it has started \"organizing\" as it is used to. - Try it. It works for many people.

Disclaimer, I am not a psychologist and I don't pretend to be one online but I have been in your shoes before.\n\nFrom my observation and reading it seems that many of us prefer a definitive future. There may be many reasons why. Maybe it is because of the English languages inability to express the future tense, maybe its the evolution of the human brain or maybe its progression of modern societies. \n\nThe data suggests that rates of stress, anxiety, depression and unhappiness is growing across the globe (especially in the US). \n\nI have found a lot of relief in learning more about the limitations of our brains (our monkey brain). I think it is really valuable to learn that no matter how intelligent and empathetic we are we have biological and psychological limitations. When I accepted that I wasn't perfect a huge weight dropped from my shoulders. When I was younger I had this cognitive distortion of perfectionism. I thought I was perfect and I thought I had to always be perfect. That meant I couldn't make mistakes. If and when I made a mistake is was disastrous! \n\nMy mistakes would spiral into a host of negative thoughts and labels I shouldn't repeat. I would even lose sleep. In short, it took me many years to see how counter productive this cognitive distortion of perfectionism was for me in the present (my life stunk and I was always stressed) and how much it stunted my growth for the future. No one is perfect. NO ONE! I think that once we accept and understand this we can then start solving problems. \n\nAnother thing I started paying close attention to was the beauty of uncertainty (as crazy as that sounds). I have always been interested in contrast (Yin and Yang). If you didn't have uncertainty think about what you would lose in your life. Without sadness you would never experience happiness. Without uncertainty there is no appreciation for random acts of kindness, love, happiness, or life.\n\nAnd this brings me to my final point. Life is uncertain. Always and forever. I have clients who may be at the pinnacle of their success and even if their work like isn't uncertain, there family is. It doesn't matter who you are, how much money you have, what life stage you are in, life is uncertain.

For me, when something great comes along that I feel so grateful for, I feel guilty for it and I get an overwhelming sense of dread and doom that something bad will come along soon when I least expect it in order to put a balance of negativity back into my life. What a depressing perspective, but that\u2019s genuinely how I used to think.\n\nI recently quit my job at a horrible cafe where management were mistreating me for a whole year, like underpaying me, changing my shifts last minuet and generally manipulating me. I realised though in this time of working with my colleagues that I loved listening to their problems and trying to help them come to a solution. After a month of unemployment I felt so lost with what I should be doing next, but then an amazing opportunity came to me at a taster session for a transformative hypnotherapy diploma. Basically, this amazing woman called Avril Gill is a transformational coach and hypnotherapist and was the one who opened up a door for me when I thought there was nothing left that could motivate me. She\u2019s worked with hundreds of clients in being able to transform them into the person they want to be through generative hypnotherapy. It\u2019s a newer kind of hypnotherapy which is different to the classical types such as authoritarian (which a lot of stage performers like Derren Brown use) in that you as the hypnotherapist are ultimately helping the client tap into that sense of self again. She as also had a very dramatic life full of unfortunate but she found the voice which started her journey on to reinventing herself. She even wrote a book about how you can do this, and I finished reading it a day ago. I would really recommend reading it if you feel like you have these self sabotaging thoughts that you constantly identify with. Because the truth is that although we have suffered from traumatic events, we do deserve an amazing life in the future, and we shouldn\u2019t let our pasts shape our future happiness. We can change today, if that\u2019s what we really want x \n\nP.s. I\u2019m sorry if you read all of that and are confused about a lot. I rarely talk about myself and things I find truly inspiring because I worry people will mock me for it.

My self esteem about my cognitive abilities was pretty high actually.\n\nBut I still was doubting myself because I was not really working hard to be one of the best in my classes.

So I used to procastinate till like 2 3 weeks before exams and then put full effort to pass the exams. In the Most cases, I passed the exam, mostly with not that good grades. But at least I passed. On the one hand, I kept telling myself that under the circumstances _how_ I studied (depression, (social) anxieties, financial problems, started working parttime in the first Year of Uni) the grades were not that bad. Especially if you consider that more than 80 percent drop studying after first year in these subjects. And there were also plenty of people in my circles at the university, who despite of studying the whole semester, attending classes etc did not pass.\n\n\nOn the other hand I very often felt like it was a fraud what I was doing and that I am a little piece of sh*t who could not organize his day and as a consequence was miserably failing in life and university.

But years later I found out that that was simply the way she taught. Her Russian heritage combined with her personality meant that she would very rarely give compliments, even when someone was playing very well, but rather point out what one would have to do to make it even better. Her wiping the floor with was actually meant as a \"I see something more in you than you are showing right now and I am  determined to let you live up to it\" (I later saw her teach someone who was actually doomed to fail the Conservatoire, and that was very different from how I was taught).  \nHer methods didn't really agree with me, so I finally got the courage to talk to her about that. And you know what? Not only did she explain her teaching methods to me, making me understand that she didn't *really* think I was worthless but was trying to coax me into living up to my potential, she also actively tried a less harsh approach so that I would feel better during her lessons. And I've really come to respect her for that, as not everyone is able or willing to change their way of treating students.

This sort of interactions happen mostly online where strangers have complimented my articles.\n\nI feel like the bond I share with these people are quite brittle even though we've been friends for years. The fact that I don't interact with them face to face, I can't see the honesty behind their facial expressions.

I'll feel the imposter syndrome again whenever I'll mess up or if I need the help of the seniors to overcome something I can't quite get my head around.\n\nA potential cure?\n\nI think we feel like this most of the time because we lack these back-patting from people who mean a lot to us.

It's easy to do and in our industry, it's something that happens often. When you measure yourself against another, you're putting someone in the position of \"better than\" or \"lower than\" and that's not fair to either party. Instead remember you come with different experience and different skills from the next engineer. \n\nCareer tips:\nWith that being said,  confidence in yourself is important when interviewing. You can know all the languages in the world,  have all the experience or best grades, that will likely just get you in the door. Focus on your soft skills, your ability to see challenges and face them head on. Learn how to work across multiple skill levels and teach jr dev's. Remember to be humble and to never stop learning.\n\nProfessional tips:\nDevelop your emotional intelligence while you develop your coding skills. This will greatly set you apart from the pack and make you as more viable candidate. This will also help you develop confidence and get out of your head when things get tough. \n\nWhen I did hiring rounds,  I had plenty of ppl with experience interview. Most ppl forget to be human,  be vulnerable and be a team player.  So I looked for those with technical skill, great character,  and a healthy mindset. I never expect anyone to know everything. I do expect people to be hungry to learn. The mindset was if I can connect with you, then I could develop you.  \n\nMore tips:\nDon't worry about knowing everything either.  Focus on languages and tech you do enjoy.  Understand why you enjoy it.  Learn about your strengths and how to use them. Do things till you are proud of yourself and that will increase your confidence. Never be afraid of failing. \n\n\nLast thought:\nThe sheer fact you are asking this question shows me you're farther along than most developers I know. You will go far!

I guess I am hoping someone can suggest a course of action.\n\nMy mother and I have always been close growing up. She was a single mom in the military with just me as an only child, so our mother-daughter bond was very tight. So much so that it blurred the lines of parent-child relationship and ventured more and more into friendship as I got older. \n\nI moved out at 17 to go to university, and she slipped into intense depression due to \"empty nesting\" for a couple of years as a result. Eventually, she got out that funk and we maintained a close relationship despite the distance apart. I called her daily, shared my life stories, asked for advice, and traveled to see her every holiday break.\n\nFast forward a bit, I am approaching 30 and I live in the same city as her, I am married, and for the past 3 years our relationship has suffered. She was injured while on duty in the military in the early 90s, and was reinjured 3 years ago because someone rear ended her on the highway. As a result, she has gone through extensive therapies and has been on a multitude of drugs to cope with the chronic pain. She was medically released from the military and suffers from extreme anxiety, depression, and PTSD. When all of this first happened 3 years ago, I was her rock and her shoulder to cry on. Eventually, it became too much for me to shoulder and I started to back off for my own mental wellbeing. Her husband finally stepped in and has been a great support for her, as he should be, so that has taken a lot of the burden off of me.\n\nBut now, I find my mother to be insufferable. The meds she is on has caused her to act differently over the years. She is more introverted and socially awkward than she used to be. She is also extremely negative and selfish. Talking to her is draining, and my husband and I are struggling with how self righteous she can be. To expand on that, she will buy us something for Christmas then spend forever saying \"oh look I bought you that\", \"dont you use that X I bought you anymore\", \"hey I help! I bought you X\", \"this is from me, it was VERY expensive\". Stuff like that. It really annoys my husband and I for obvious reasons.\n\nSo now I don't call her because I can't handle typical conversation with her. I don't think of her as often as I used to. I don't worry as much anymore. I'm focused on starting my own life and trying to work out my own mental health issues, because I cannot shoulder her negativity anymore. \n\nIt makes me sad that she isn't the person she used to be because of the chronic pain and medications  and so I have naturally pulled away from her both sub-consciously and consciously. So now, I am guilted that I dont talk to her or visit anymore. I'm not sure how to handle this, because she already has enough demons to fight.\n\nOther tidbits in case it matters: My biological father is not in the picture. Step father is a cool guy but we were never super close. Husband knew my mom before and after her reinjury and is also at his wits end and does not appreciate how she treats me sometimes.\n\nWhat do I do to solve this, or mend the relationship?

About 2 weeks ago my mum went fucking crazy and threatened to take all my money out (she made my account when I was 4, so she has equal to more access to it as I do.). Knowing how fucking crazy she is, I believed her and cancelled the card, made a new bank account with a different bank, got my money transferred from my old to the new, then cancelled the old, all behind my mum\u2019s back, with my dads knowledge. \nWhat I didn\u2019t know is that the new bank automatically sends out a new fucking card as soon as you sign up to it. And guess what happened today? My mum got it in the mail. She\u2019s the only person who has keys to the letterbox. She didn\u2019t tell me about it. The only way I found out was because she left the bank letter on the table- with the card taken out. \n\nWhat I\u2019m pissed about is why tf she just can\u2019t let me use my own fucking money. I literally worked for it. It\u2019s also money that was GIFTED to me by my friends and family. And despite me being almost an adult, she doesn\u2019t let me touch SHIT.

My family has always been pretty toxic. Most of this stems from my dad, who is a manipulative, cheating, lying drunk, who is only happy when he is making other people miserable. I can't ever remember a time him and my mom actually got along, and I have so many memories of my family and I having panic attacks when he would come home from business trips because everything had to be PERFECT or we wouldn't know what to expect from him. To list a couple of his worst offenses, he shipped my older brothers from my mother's previous marriages off to their abusive dad because he \"Never wanted kids\" even though he knew my mom had kids before he pursued her. He would later use that same phrase on my sister and I at every turn.\nHe also pulled my sister off or a wooden porch into the air and choked her out while shaking her back and forth, which he swears to this day NEVER HAPPENED. He constantly made me apologize in highschool for \"embarrassing him in front of his friends and being disrespectful \" when I would make them stop making inappropriate comments or other actions that were aimed at me. He would often punch holes in walls, throw things at us, go through belongings when we were gone, and he would ask my female friends horribly inappropriate questions whenever I wasn't present. But one of the things I resent him the most for is fetishizing my mother's  childhood molestation. He has always mistreated her, isolating her from friends and family, ignoring her health both physically and mentally, and any time she wouldn't do as he wanted he would threaten her with divorce. He has also helped ruin my sister's life to the point I don't know if she will ever escape it at this point. Unfortunately, she has continued to fall into abusive relationships as an adult because of all of this. I am now a grown woman who has found happiness in a town pretty far away from my family with my husband, and I'm honestly so much happier away from all of the dysfunction that I grew up in. My husband has been by my side for quite some years now, and he is probably one of the only reasons I have learned to stand up for myself. \nAnyway, all of this aside, in recent years, I have tried to bridge the gap between my family and I, because I was tired of being angry. My parents are in their sixties, and I know they wont be here forever, so I just want to forgive and love them while I can. That was going well and great for awhile too, but like everything he has found a way to ruin it again. I had my entire family over for my sister and I to have a late birthday celebration at my house, and he spent the entire night picking fights with her until they ended up yelling in my front yard until I told him to leave, because I would not allow that kind of behavior or disrespect in my house or my neighborhood. He left, got drunk, and the rest of us set and felt sorry for ourselves because the celebration was ruined. I have never had a birthday party in my life, and all I wanted was a nice afternoon with my family to pretend we were normal for once. Illusion immediately ruined. Currently, two months later, my mother is having a cancer scare and my mother says they are getting divorced because of my dad's horrible treatment of both her and my sister. But honestly, I'm not sure she will actually leave. She has claimed she was going to leave for over 20 years now, and I've lost hope that it will happen. As an adult it took me years to accept how bad I had been raised because I would always parrot my mother's assurance that \"Its not always that bad\" and \"We've had some good times too\"\nIn the end, my relationship with both of them has pretty much been ruined beyond repair because of my dad's manipulative behavior and my mother using my sister and I as therapist since we were kids and her tendency to share personal information about my sister and I in order to win favor with him. I no longer trust them, and I dont know how to let it go anymore. I feel so bad because I want to love them, but it feels like I'll have to sacrifice all the progress I've made in 10 years just to do that. Which I'm not willing to do, so I have very little to do with any of them anymore. \n\nTL;DR\nMy father's horrible manipulation tactics and abusive tendencies, as well as my mother's unwillingness to admit the true weight of the situation has alienated me to the point of pretty much no contact", "score": 1, "subreddit": "FamilyIssues", "best_comment": "", "second_best_comment": ""}, {"title": "Update on too loud... my solution to my loud family tonight \ud83e\udd7a", "id": "f6mgov", "body": "", "score": 66, "subreddit": "FamilyIssues", "best_comment": "I need something like that for my family, all they do is fight", "second_best_comment": "This is much better solution  than setting your alarm for 4 am to get up and have some peace and quiet time while everyone else is asleep"}, {"title": "Grandparents making a difference with there grand kids.", "id": "f704ls", "body": "What I'm about to write, is the up most truth, and not the truth being over exaggerated, or lied just plain old that is how it is, and was hoping on replies of how to understand this?\n\nI live only 10 minute drive from my family, I visit every week, mainly once a week, as I have two kids and one on the way, and work life, but this is the only time I see them!\n\nNow my father had cancer and I am ever so proud of him beating it and lucky to still have him in my and kids life, this happened three years ago, but before his cancer my parents would never ring, text or call just replies from my actions, they used to take my kids twice  a week, untill we got a car and then dropped to once and then either collect or drop off, \nGot told they don't like minding babies, OK eemmm but what could I do, then when my oldest son got a bit older, they went to mind him over night, they said never again, he cried, they said we couldn't put the child threw that again??\nSo in other words gave up, me and my partner asked for help as we both got jobs, which was needing shared help between both sets of grandparents, either on Friday or the weekend, my parents help out for a while and when I say helped they minded the kids for four hours whilst the other grandmother did the rest, and that wasn't even her day to help, that lasted for one month, and they said we can help on a Thursday, which was a day that none of us worked as they would like to have the weekend and Fridays to them self's, so my partner had to give up her job.\n\nBut my parents hit me with the old ways of how it was for them, of how they couldn't get us minded when we were kids, everytime I asked them to help me? \n\nNow this is we're the understanding comes, in through everything I have explained, my parents have been keeping my sisters kids over night, they always denied it, but when theres kids tooth brushes in there house, as in the bathroom, also a set of drawers in the spare room, full of kids clothing, my sisters kids, my dad always trips him self up, saying I'm tired getting up early to bring the child to school, then try and correct himself by saying he ment something else, my younger brother that still lives there getting upset if his ps4 not working, saying when my nephew stays here I no he is touching it, and when my lovely wee niece was born all of a sudden the is a high chair down the stairs and a travel cot in there bedroom, always explaining why it was there and my sister keeps forgetting to pick it up! \nBut yet dissappears when she gets old enough to walk.

Our parents could never agree on the rules for us. Mom would say do X, dad would say to do the exact opposite. To respect one parent was to disrespect the other. My brother was always loyal to mom, while I thought for myself: whichever parent gave the instruction that required less of me was always the one I chose. I was very explicit about this. However, the landed me on my dad's side about 80% of the time. Whichever parent I didn't chose would be very angry and say that I was morally corrupt, unprepared for the future, and selfish. Despite all of this, I regard my home life until \\~13 years old as generally good. The no-win situation was not a nightly occurrence (maybe once every two weeks, which is still alot) and I do have some genuinely good memories with my family: game nights, movie nights, vacations, swimming, parties, etc. I also had a third major influence in my life: my cousin. She would always remind me that the no-win situations were not my fault and that the insults from my mom weren't true (notice how I said \"mom\"- my cousin's one flaw is not realizing that sometimes, dad was the problem). This, however, is why things took a turn for the worse.\n\nThe way my mother treated me caused my aunt, uncle, and cousin to lose alot of respect for my mom. They began to enjoy her company less and criticize her every move. My mom was in turn upset by the fact that my cousin's reassurance cancelled out my mom's insults. She would discuss this issue with my dad, who would defend his own relatives. This began to hurt the relationship between my two parents. I still, however, still was a generally happy person and mostly let these issues go. Although, I did notice that things were taking a turn for the worse and started to include in my prayers \"God, please heal my family\". One summer, while at church in an abnormal place and time, I heard during a homily, \"God will only help you if you help yourself\". Right after church I thought to myself, \"Maybe I need to try to push my family back together (help myself) in order to heal it (God will help you)\". I started off subtly, still not involving myself in my parents' arguments, which were about total trivia at this point. The no-win situations for me and my brother were mostly over, but hard feelings remained, so they argued about nonsense, like \"you bought the wrong brand of saltines\", \"you forgot to use Amazon Smile\", and \"you took too long to take down the Christmas tree\" (there have been years where the Christmas tree was still up on Ash Wednesday, especially when it was early, but that is nothing worth arguing over). All I would do was, after an argument, tell both parents that their argument was over trivia, what things they said were too harsh, and that they should love each other more. This did absolutely nothing to help. My mom began to focus on her relationship with my brother and my dad began to focus on his relationship with me. This lifestyle continued through all of my high school years.\n\nAll that changed in one day, which was my high school graduation party. There were plenty of arguments that went into planning the day, so of course tensions were high. My cousin helped alot, which upset my mom. That day was one of the rare days that I saw my dad's side and mom's side at the same time. After all the years of tension with my cousin, my mom took her revenge by spilling some of my dad's family's secrets to her family. My cousin found out about this and nothing was the same ever since. My mom and cousin haven't talked since (I am now in my last semester of college). My reaction to the issues changed too. Now, I did start inserting myself into my parents' arguments. I told them things like \"you're terrible partners for each other\", and \"this family is now terrible and I want to get away\". Now, when I'm home from college, I blow up over things like \"we don't go to church together anymore\" (we don't- my mom/brother go Saturday night while me/my dad go Sunday morning) and \"we don't eat dinner together anymore\" (my mom/brother eat in the dining room while me/my dad eat at the kitchen counter and often at different times too). I've been begging my parents to work on their relationship, saying that someday, when me and my brother are both out of the house (he's in the moving-out process now) that they will live miserable lives without their relationship. The last time I was home, my mom said that she is planning on moving out with my brother and my dad said that he has so many friends that he can live a full life without my mom. This should have calmed me down, knowing that my parents would be happy, but it actually made me more angry. The idea that my parents could be happy without the tight-knit family we once had INFURIATES me. I don't want everyone to learn to live with the issues, I want to fix them. \n\nI did get a short-lived taste of freedom though: my junior spring abroad in Spain. For a long time, my dad threatened me that he wouldn't let me go, but finally did, thinking that I would \"see a different lifestyle and come back OK with the family issues\". I was OK while I was in Spain, and I talked about the family issues for maybe 5 minutes in the entire 5 months I was over there. It was so relieving.\n\nWhen I returned from Spain, I thought I was actually fine, but I slowly regressed into my past ways of anger and sadness, having completely returned to my not-as-good self by the time senior year of college began. I have told my parents that without their issues, I would have a girlfriend right now (this is not a general statement, there is a specific girl I have in mind and what happened to her is a story of its own, but one I promised her I wouldn't tell), I constantly harp on \"what would we be doing now without family issues?\", and tell my dad how uncomfortable I am with being his primary source of happiness. This has now led my cousin to criticize me, saying that I should've been loyal to my dad and that \"having a father who loves you is not the worst thing in the world\". I am less fun than I used to be at family events.

Needless to say, I was devastated. After a few girlfriends my dad found my third step mother when I turned into a Senior in High school. ( I still am) They had a nice little wedding down at the beach with her family but they never bothered to tell us they were even engaged. I wasn\u2019t mad at her I was frustrated with my dad but I didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m not one to voice my concerns. But she is the one this story is about (I\u2019ll call her Tabby for privacy).\n\nTabby never really seemed to like me. I would try an engage in conversation but she wouldn\u2019t really contribute to the conversation, but she also never paid me much attention. For some more context, One day I was swimming in the hand me down stand up pool my dad got with Tabby\u2019s only daughter and my 2 cousins. The oldest cousin was looking at a Barbie doll she\u2019d put in the pool, and had a fit when my cousin \u201ctouched her things\u201d. I made the mistake of trying to calm her down because her response was to pull out my hair and call me a b***h. This girl is 4 y\u2019all. But my face of anger that day could kill and she got out of the pool and ran to her mom. I told Tabby about her daughters behavior and she blamed us and babied her daughter. I later told my dad and he was infuriated. He gave her a stern lecture and grounded her. That whole situation just stuck to me. But that\u2019s nothing compared what happens the weekend after this past Christmas (12/28/19).\n\n\nI came down to visit for my Christmas break. While I was down my dad had to work for a few days. My step sister (from my second step mom) called me and asked if I wanted to hang out for the day. I jumped at the opportunity to get out the house and see my sister. I asked my dad if I could go, he said of course, and left me come money to go out and eat. I spend the day visiting my family  (my 2nd step mom and her parents) and go out to eat at huddle house with my step sister. Exchange gifts, stories, and over all have a good time. Upon returning to my dads house, Dad isn\u2019t home and Tabby was waiting at the door. She barrated me about the few dishes in the sink and clothes in my room (not yelling yet just fussing). I was confused by her tone.\n\u201cHow old are you\u201d\n\u201cDo you live like this at your house\u201d\nThere were 4 dishes and 2 sets of clothes on my bed. I had only been there for a day and a half not including this one. The thing is she didn\u2019t even have to tell me because I was planning on cleaning that stuff up anyways. That made me uneasy but didn\u2019t bother me much. Then it went down.\n\nI was in my room finishing cleaning up when she came into the doorway. The then started yelling at me about how my previous step mom and step sister are not my family anymore ,how they\u2019re bad people, how I need to look for new friends, I should never contact them again, etc. She left and I couldn\u2019t take it. I ran out the back foot and hid behind the shed, and I just cried. These people are far from bad and I\u2019ve known them for as long as I can remember. They are still my family and they see me the same way. You couldn\u2019t ask for a better family than them. I tried calling my sister (Older blood related sister) but she didn\u2019t answer. So I called my mom and told her everything. She told me to call my dad. Like I said I\u2019m not one to voice my concerns but I did. I broke down to my dad. I told him everything. He told me to go inside, Go in my room, Close the door, and charge my phone (it was around 6%). So I did. My dad called Tabby to confront her and I herd yelling, lots of it. Then she came into my room. She yelled at me called me a liar and said that I was going to be the reason they had a divorce. She tried to call him on her phone but he wouldn\u2019t answer. She then forced me to call my dad. When he answered she started yelling calling him a motherf****r among many things. He never raised his voice. She asked me \u201cdid I yell at you?\u201d I said yes. My dad hung up and she stormed out. I ran. Right back out to behind the shed. I cried, and cried. I was so scared. I vigorously texted my dad telling him I was sorry and I never wanted this to happen. He said it was okay. I called my mom and she said she was on her way. She lives 2 hour away. For 2 hours I cried outside until my mom picked me up and I left a week early. \n\nThe fallout was bad too. Tabby contacted my sister and I have 15 screenshots of their conversation. She tried to contact my mom but my mom on Facebook declined. My dad found that Tabby got on his phone and blocked everyone from my 2nd step moms family. My dad helped raise my step sister and was livid to find missed messages from her to walk her at prom and attend her HS graduation. But through it all they worked it out and they\u2019re staying together. They want to talk over dinner and I have screenshots of those too\n\nGuys I need help. I need advice on how I should handle myself around her. I am 18 now I want to conduct myself in an adult manner. No screaming, no yelling, just calmness and composure. What should I say? What should I do?\n\nIt\u2019s past 12am now I\u2019m going to bed. I will add the screenshots tomorrow and fix any grammar mistakes. I will read yalls responses in the morning. I cried during typing this and I hope y\u2019all can help me out.\n\n[Tabby\u2019s convo to my sister](https://imgur.com/a/2PpOgFa) \n\nI spliced the screenshots together the best I could and I edited out our names\n\n[Dads convo with all of us](https://imgur.com/a/cE7trNX)", "score": 2, "subreddit": "FamilyIssues", "best_comment": "", "second_best_comment": ""}, {"title": "Resentful towards parents for horrible childhood", "id": "f5cjha", "body": "Hi everyone! I am 6 months pregnant. While I\u2019ve had anger and resentment towards my own parents for a long time now, it had become so unbearable and I find it impossible to forgive them or talk to them while I am pregnant. Here is a summary of my childhood: I was born in China and my parents left me to come to the US- my dad left when I was a few days old and my mom left when I was 1. I stayed with my grandparents in China. When I was 5, I left my grandparents and came to live with my parents in the US. I remember this was very traumatic for me because I left the only family I knew and started a life in the US where I did not know the language and was made fun of a ton and had to repeat first grade because my parents sent me to school without learning basic English.\n\nWhat really kills me is that my parents decided to move away from me when I was an infant- it did not need to happen (we were not refugees or in danger, my dad just wanted to get away from communism and live the American dream which he failed at). We had a loving family right there in China, would have been completely fine and even had the chance to be successful without moving to the US So I feel- if they wanted to do that they should have waited to have a child. Having one just to fit social norms (that\u2019s what it was) and then leave is extremely selfish.\n\nMy parents left me home alone as early as age 7 all day long for a whole summer because they could not afford daycare. I remember feeling extremely lonely and scared. My dad had a bad temper and would blow up often. Once, around 8 years old, the neighbors called the cops because I was locked out and he yelled at me for locking myself out and getting the police involved. And another time he left me in the car to sleep for several hours while he went gambling. I must have been around 10... the cops saw me in the car and got me that time too. That time he did not get angry but said \u201cgood thing they let me off with a warning, I thought they were going to give me trouble\u201d so he knew it was wrong (or at least illegal)\n\nWhen I was in 4th grade, my parents got divorced and did not talk to me about the divorce at all- did not say anything so I was left to internalize all my emotions. My mom had a new boyfriend and started living with him and left me with my dad (who was a shitty dad and left me in a tiny back room of a crappy tv repair shop he had with a bunch of old dirty electronics). But my mom came and got me in 6th grade and she lived with me again. Middle school years were happy- my mom was actually a good mom when she was there, for the most part. She did ignore all symptoms of me being anorexic at 14 even tho they were very much obvious, and didn\u2019t think anything of it. She also signed me up for miss teen USA and complained about me not getting enough awards and yelled at me for not making sports teams. Those were prob the worst of it- other than that she was present and available for me.\n\nBut, then she left again to go with the boyfriend overseas this time and left me again with my dad in high school. I lived with my dad and his crazy ex gf, which was not pleasant for a couple years. But then with my mom again 11th-12th grade and was happy again for those times. When I graduated and started working, I supported my mom completely financially. Gave her all of my leftover money because I thought that\u2019s what I should do so I have no savings and she lived a luxurious life of fun and traveling and not working for the last 10 years. I am super resentful about it now thinking back on it. More in comments (word limit)...\n\nTl;dr - my parents royally sucked at being parents- which traumatized me. I\u2019m pregnant and emotional and get angry when I think about them, leaving me to avoid them.\n\nSo my question is- is it ok for me to not talk to my parents even as they\u2019re getting older?", "score": 18, "subreddit": "FamilyIssues", "best_comment": "Continued- I was much happier living on my own being independent, but when I started therapy realized I have a lot of issues in my adult life because of my parents. The first and foremost is my unhealthy attachment and relationships- it was nearly impossible for me to get out of toxic relationships because I could not handle feeling abandoned. So I stayed in MANY very toxic relationships and could not get out of them until it become beyond intolerable- way more drawn out, miserable and intense than any relationship cutoff should have been. I felt unbearably uncomfortably and anxious being single so I always rushed into relationships with people I should have never been with, and then dragged it out beyond misery- this was the story of the last 10 years of my life.\n\nNow I am in a good place and got really lucky with my partner. And for the first time feel settled with someone- that I am with him because he is perfect for me and not just to cure my anxiety. but I still feel unstable and less happy than I should because I am always anxious. I blame my parents for a lot of that anxiety because I feel I am very calm about stressors that do not deal with abandonment (like work stress for instance).\n\nMy parents are not mean people. I honestly believed they meant well much of the time (I will admit there were many times they were selfish), but were mostly \u201cstupid\u201d at raising a child. There is a huge cultural difference between where they had grown up (in the middle of nowhere rural China) and what parenting means here. That is the excuse my mom gives me, but I know it\u2019s not an excuse. I feel things they had done were just plain wrong no matter what culture, but I\u2019m also hesitant to be too harsh because I don\u2019t know what it was like to be in their situation. I\u2019d also like to add that there was very little focus on mental health and emotional development of children where my parents lived- it\u2019s kind of a cold practical culture. So I do believe that desensitized them to what was right and wrong.\n\nI find it so hard to forgive them or even talk to them. I am afraid I will regret it. But I still cannot talk to them without extreme anger bubbling up inside of me", "second_best_comment": "Your parents lived their lives their way and the impact on you was devastating. You have worked hard to be who you are. Since they did just what they pleased, does that allow you to live your life as you please now?

(mobile formatting so forgive me please)\n\nI am an 18 (nearly 19) year old girl, and my younger brother is turning 14 in April. He lives with my dad and our stepmom (and their four year old), and I moved out of his house when I was 17 and am now attending University. I have a lot of issues with my father that I believe to be justified, that aren't as typical as \"wah wah teen angst I hate my parents\" type stuff that all teenagers experience. I moved out of his house when I was 17 to live with my friends because the home environment was bad for my mental health and my relationship with my father. My father is a crook, cheater, predator, and a non-convicted pedophile. While he never touched me (to my knowledge, though I don't remember anything before age 10,) he molested my half-sister and his sister, both while they were young. He also got together with my now stepmom and his wife when she was 17/18, and he is going to be 55 this year. He's a total creep and I've always felt uncomfortable around him, as have my friends growing up. Though not being a full-blown sociopath, he has a variety of sociopathic traits and tendencies which have kept us from developing a \"normal\" father-daughter bond to this day.\n\nOkay, enough back story. This year, when I went to go file my taxes, I got rejected for my state and federal. This is because he claimed me as a dependent, despite me not relying on him for any sort of financial support for all of 2019. In order to get my tax return, I had to file as a dependent while being self-reliant in order to get my money because he refuses to refile his taxes. This caused me to lose all of my educational deductions and credits. I've been considering reporting him to the IRS for tax fraud, which I told my brother. In every situation, regardless of who is in the wrong, my brother always supports my father and looks past all the wrong he does (much more than just the tax thing, but I won't go into detail.) I partly understand why, because our mother has never been a stable part of his life (or mine, as she is a meth addict and alcoholic with severe mental impairments as a result,) so I can see why he would idolize my father as a way to have some semblance of a normal family. But I don't want my hatred for my father and my brothers adoration for him to distance is, because I love my brother more than anything in the world. I want so badly to tell him about the horrible things he's done to the people in our life, but I'm conflicted. I don't know if I should tell him and possibly shatter his view of him, which may cause him to become depressed. But I also want him to realize that our father isn't a good person. I found this out from personal experience at an age younger than him, but I don't know if he's still too young to hear about these things. I know that no parent is perfect, but I believe the things my father has done more than qualify him to be a particularly shitty person. I understand it's selfish of me to want to taint his and my brothers relationship, but these are my raw thoughts. I suppose this is more just venting than asking for advice, but if anyone has input it'd be very much appreciated.

My mom and my brother\u2019s SO (We\u2019ll call her N.) never really got along, since my mom\u2019s a generally more \u201ctraditional\u201d family type woman and N is a really blunt and independent type of woman. N and my brother have two kids as well that we help babysit sometimes.\n\nMy mom and I didn\u2019t really have the best relationship growing up, mostly for stuff just living at home but also she\u2019d be highly critical of me and it led to some self-esteem issues that I still somewhat struggle with. I\u2019ve also felt as though I\u2019ve acted as the mediator for most of my family\u2019s arguments. My dad leaves a lot for business trips as well, so while he\u2019s present sometimes, he\u2019s not around too often. \n\nBasically the start of our family falling apart was a few months ago, when my brother found out N had been cheating on him. They argued for a few days, and the arguments would turn physical, with N throwing things at my brother and him trying to restrain her so that she\u2019d stop. Eventually, N got a restraining order, with pressure from her mom (our neighbor) to write down that my brother had attacked her. She also verbally attacked my brother over the phone. This led to my brother being arrested for a few days, and a legal scare for a few weeks. He would suffer panic attacks every day since he couldn\u2019t see his kids and N. \n\nSince then, my brother has been living back at home with us. We\u2019ve provided support while my brother signed himself up for therapy and anger management classes, and has been exercising more frequently. He got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and takes medication for it. \n\nMeanwhile, it seems like issues between our family have gotten more pronounced and somewhat come out more often. I\u2019ve been arguing more with my parents about my independence and feeling suffocated as well as feeling like I\u2019m the therapist, my mom feels like she\u2019s just there to serve everyone and has had to give up her dreams so she can fix our messes, and my dad feels like he\u2019s just the provider and that he\u2019s losing connection with me (although in my perspective, I feel like this is partly due to the frequent traveling). As for my brother, he often feels like my parents treat him like a teenager again, and somewhat gets the same suffocation feeling. My parents feel as though I\u2019ve stopped giving a shit about them, and that me and my brother just go off and do our own thing and have forgotten family values.\n\nIn short, what I\u2019ve generally observed is we\u2019ve issues living with each other for the past few months, and our goals and needs are clashing and we don\u2019t know how to communicate them effectively. This has lead to a lot of screaming matches, several of us threatening to move out (myself included), threats of separation, etc. I\u2019ve tried to express to my parents multiple times that I want us to go to family counseling so we can stop the cycle of fighting over the same thing. However, when I express this, there\u2019s usually not an acknowledgement or direct answer about it, it kinda goes back to how horrible THEIR life is and why we should help them. That said, I do want to make clear I feel awful about the stuff my parents have had to endure, and I want to make it easier for them. \n\nHowever it\u2019s frustrating every single time I bring up to just try out a solution to it, I\u2019m met with \u201cWell, all families fight\u201d or a competition as to whose suffering the most.

For about two or three years, I went to a private school for kids with disorders such as autism, downs syndrome, etc. The teachers there are abusive and cruel.\nSince I was in late elementary, my mom has gotten mad at me for no reason and beats me when that happens. It's only gotten worse over the years.\nMy dad and I got into in argument on August 16, 2016. My mom had to come pick me up. As we were leaving, he shouted \"Don't bother coming back!\" I haven't seen him since.\nLate elementary, my grandpa and I had been rivals. We would get into arguments. Fourth or fifth grade is when depression started, though I didn't know about it. I couldn't sleep at night, so I slept in and missed some of school.\nI'm surprised I even had friends during elementary. Kids were typically afraid of me. Maybe that's why they were friends. Fear. Now people believe I'm some Satanic kidnapper and torturer, so they genuinely fear me. Some just pity me, I'm sure. None of my friends treat me like other friends. They won't willingly give me their phone numbers. They won't even give me a hug\nMy brother's biological brother's dad died recently, so he has to live with us. He grew up in the rough part of town (the \"hood\"). His dad was abusive. Since he lives with us, he still has the mentality of his past life. He believes our rules don't apply to him. He has ADHD, but that's no excuse for his behavior. I was diagnosed as a psycho, and you don't see me going around hurting people. About an hour ago, him and I got into an argument. He was shouting for no reason. His phone was right there, and he was on a call. He's just a kid, so why his he quoting Ninja in \"THE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT?\" over and over? His dad is gone, and he deserves it. He is rotting in Hell. \nI took his PS4 and hid it in my room because he wouldn't calm the fuck down and shut the fuck up. To get it back, he sweared at me and punched me. My fucking grandma took his fucking side, when I was clearly the one in the right. She always taked the other person's side.\nNo one loves me. No one will care if I'm gone. I could disappear right now, and no one will bat an eye.\nI swear, I am actually going to murder someone. I will stab them, tie a noose around their neck, and push them down the stairs. I will peel the first layer of their skin with a tip of a pencil. I will carve \"SLAYER\" into their forearm. \nI have a friend that went to my school last year. She only went there one year because of drama. The school I go to is terrible. She now goes back to her old school, which isn't that far. Though, I never see her.\nMy other friend lives in the same state as me, but she's an online friend. I can't see her.

My parents were divorced when I was 9 years old. I have a sister who is 19 in college away. I on the other hand am in high school. I am finishing my last semester right now. I have my dad's house and my mom's house. My dad is (51) and my step mom is (46)  I also have a step sister over there who is (16). I tend to get along with my dad more but I will get into that later. \n\nAt my mom's house I have her (44) and my step dad (53) and a step sister who is not here that much who is (14). \n\nSo here is what went down. I have never tried drinking because I don't agree with it but I tried smoking. I tried it one time in the summer and now I got some more and used it 3 other times recently and then my mom suspected it and my dad searched my vehicle. He found it all and was very disappointed.  He pushed me around a little and then told me to get in my car and go to work. I was thinking about it the whole time and was very upset. I went back home to my moms and there was a letter that stated that I needed to start going to a counselor and that my gf (18f) would no longer be aloud to go downstairs where my room is ever again. I also have to do regular drug tests and if I don't pass my mom said she will tell my girlfriends parents. The part that bothered me was the thought that they think I couldn't stop. My mom also is a counselor. Her husband is a psychologist who is from Pakistan. My mom took the approach of investigation and interrogation. She took out a pen and paper and started asking me questions about it and kept pushing. My step dad took verbal punches at me saying if I would have given my dad a heart attack it would have been all my fault if he had died. \n\nI also have to input that I'm not normally a bad kid nor was I on a bad path. I have a job, I am on varsity soccer and have been since I was a freshman, I have made huge progress in my job and am working my way up the rankings.  My grades have been A's and B's. I'm a part time student who only needs half a credit more. I also pay for my own car. I fix my own car. I have built computers and so on. I'm a very active kid not some lazy dead beat. \n\nAnyway for my dad's approach to all of it. He was very upset but my step mom I'm guessing calmed him down because she had smoked weed before and also done shrooms before and she turned out to be making six figures. They sat me down and was asking why I did it and so on and I was explaining to them that I did it because I was curious and it was relaxing. I didn't do it with anyone. I just did it by myself because it was fun. They thought I was trying to self medicate or something else. My dad said he will be tracking my phone from now on and I have to ask him before I can go anywhere. I haven't gone anywhere really. It's been 2 weeks and I've went to my gf's house 1 time. My dad was saying that people who smoke are lazy and all that. I was compliant and listened to what he had to say. He said we will be spending alot of time together and he constantly checks up on me. \n\nI've spent most of my time at my dad's house recently and it's because my mom has a weird view of success where it's valued by money and not by happiness. She says I'm on a terrible path and so on. There is nothing to do at my mom's house. We never have gotten along that well so there's nothing for us to talk about. I have been to my mom's 3 times in the past 2 weeks and all I've done is sit in my room and my brain just wonders. I can't go anywhere and it doesn't help that my room has no windows. \n\nAt my dads my gf is still aloud over because he understands that she is a good influence on me. We have also been dating for a year and 4 months. He has let me go over there one time to her house. Life at my dad's has been better than at my mom's. My dad seems so actually be trying to get me on a good path and is wanting me to figure out what to do in life.\nThere's so much more but this is getting really long. Here is an example of how they are different as of right now. I was explaining to my dad how I'm going to set up a Roth IRA and a credit card soon to get a good head start and my dad was like that's good and was nice about it. I told my mom that and she rolled her eyes and was saying well then I'm going to have to pay off your debt. \n\nTo shorted this up my mom gave me an option to almost move all my stuff at her house to my dad's and just live at my dads and stop in at my mom's here and there.

Let\u2019s go back to When I was 10,\nSo my dad moved out after him and my mom have been fighting for years, I asked my mom about it. I asked her \u201care you and dad divorcing?\u201d \n\nshe replied with \u201cno, sweetie don\u2019t worry about it\u201d\n\nBut the next day I found divorce papers on the table saying that my mom wants to divorce my dad. At that moment I felt betrayed, like I couldn\u2019t trust my mom anymore. Soon after that my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, I was heartbroken ofc because I was really close to her. We all were but we found out that she survived luckily. Not too long after that a real bad car crash happened that I explained in a different sub reddit. \n\nNow we skip to march, next year 4th grade, my friend was killed in his home by his little brother. He was a twin and his little brother shot him right in the head with a gun. He wasn\u2019t only a friend but a cousin too. My mom made me go to therapy for two days, and then thought I was fine and that it was ok to just talk about my dead cousin right infront of me to her friends. Of course I started crying.\n\nNow since my car ride is almost up I\u2019m gonna get to the real reason I came here, and that\u2019s to talk about my mom. My mom is hard working woman, provides a extremely large house and food, water, etc. Yeah that\u2019s all great stuff and all, but sometimes I feel as though we (my little brother and I) are victims of child neglect. She was fine until my dad left, when my dad left she wasn\u2019t home as much of course since she had to pay for bills and stuff. Everything was fine throughout fifth grade but in sixth grade... \n\nMy grades started to drop slowly, (this will be important later on), as I made new friends and started getting used to the school. I was stressed from the beginning, not knowing where the classes were, and the counselor started to get mad with me at how many times I\u2019ve had to ask the way to classes. I\u2019ve never had very good memory since the car crash, and it just made me angry and stressed out to have the counselors mad at me for not having the best memory. Then comes in my mom. Ever since the year started I\u2019ve been getting tardes and absents when I was either looking for the classroom or at the school. There was this one time we\u2019re my engineering teacher closed the door while i was looking for the class.\n\nSkip part if you wanna \n\n( The doors in our school lock from the inside when closed so when I finally found the class I couldn\u2019t get in. I would have knocked on the door window if there was a window. I knocked on the door multiple times and went to go get a counselor when I couldn\u2019t get anyone to open it, but as soon as I started walking back up the stairs the bell rung for the next class.)\n\n\nSo basically I missed a whole class period because I couldn\u2019t knock loud enough. The counselors also got mad at me for that. When I got home my mom yelled at me for having many calls from the school about my tardes.\n\n Later in the school year, she told me to let her see my grades and I did. She screamed at me for having one F about 6 B\u2019s and only one A. She was mad at me for having a A in PE because she \u201calready knew I\u2019m athletic and skinny.\u201d I had to take care of my little brother for two years at home by cooking him oatmeal and eggs. Not saying that my mom didn\u2019t come home,  but she didn\u2019t get home till late at night meaning I had to get my little brother off the bus, feed him, and put him to sleep at his bedtime.

We were taken out of the house in our teens by the police and kind of moved house to house until we got on our own feet. I am married and have a 6 yr old. My husband and I both have full time jobs, own a home together and each have a car that is about 10 yrs old. While we make a decent living, we are living paycheck to paycheck due to some medical debt. I\u2019ve put myself through years of therapy and worked a lot on my mental health. My sister is also married, she works a retail job and gets just over minimum wage. Her husband works on and off,  he often quits or gets fired from jobs,  when he does work he spends all of his paycheck on alcohol. She has a son (18) from a previous relationship and together they have a 14yr old daughter. Her husband is verbally and emotionally abusive to all of them. He controls everything my sister does. She has no friends, isn\u2019t allowed to wear makeup or certain clothes and he he billies her about her weight. They move around a lot because they get kicked out of their rental properties for completely destroying the properties (holes in walls,  broken windows etc). They usually have 2-4 cars at a time because they but $500 junkers and cant maintain them.

Before that, I lived with my mom in NY and visited them about once or twice a year for 15 yrs. I had a tight relationship w smom and dad before I moved, but now after living w them for this long, I'm at a point where I can't stand them, and I avoid being home as much as possible so I'm mostly with my BF and his family. My BF understands that they aren't the greatest either, bc he witnessed their toxicity towards me. Even then I still feel like I'm at fault or I'm twisting the truth. But this is complete honesty from me.\n\nMy dad is iffy. We had days where everything is sunshine and rainbows and he's the coolest dad I could ask for, but then on the other side of the coin, he's very pretty and vindictive when he doesn't get his way or is proven wrong. There was once where there weren't any clean spoons for him to use and he asked me if I had any. I didn't. I took out the trash and passed the sink and there were dishes in there, including utensils, so it was fair to assume all the spoons were there. Shortly after my BF and I left to go to his house. (Note: smom and dad saw us leave; we said goodbye and everything.) Then about an hour and a half later my dad is texting me, snapping at me like,\nDad: oh, I see after you left the spoons magically disappeared again\nMe: i don't have any damn spoons\nDad: watch your mouth you're not old enough to be smacked\nMe: I apologize for cussing, but I don't enjoy being falsely accused. Besides you watched me and BF leave\nDad: yeah maybe it's about time for you to move back with your mom. You're too old to be here\n(I didn't bring up the fact that the sink was full with dishes, although I should have but I wasn't thinking about it atm. I was too angry to think straight) I ended the convo there bc it really wasn't worth my energy.\n\nNow my Smom... She's the wicked witch of the west, yet she SWEARS that she's the perfect mother. I used to believe that too. She's unemployed, lazy, manipulative, and uses her bipolar disorder to get her way. IDK if it's worth noting but she sees a therapist but her behavior never improves. I'd say it got worse over the years, but she could've been like this from the jump and I was just naive. Whenever money is tight or she and my dad get into it, she's always like 'oh y'all can keep the house bc I'm going to leave and live with my mom. By myself. Leaving my kids.' (she doesn't say that exactly, but it's heavily implied.)\nA couple years ago when I quit my first job at Chick-fil-A, she made me get a student credit card with $500 and she expected me to pay it myself. I still have yet to pay a cent bc I'm too busy paying her and trying to spoil myself bc I'm so stressed.\nRecently, we've been having financial problems since November, when I got my hours cut and lost her SSI so she's depending on my younger siblings SSI checks and my dad to pay the bills, who isn't really supposed to work in the first place. (He had an accident at work over a decade ago, and he's recovering from lung cancer.) I told her that I won't be able to pay her in full ($100 a week) and My BF's mom even told her too (bless her, she's been helping me deal with my parents so I can be less stressed and take care of myself) but it's not enough for her, even though I'm still trying my best. She gets mad and calls me selfish when I can't pay what she wants. It even got to a point where she told me to go back to my old, dangerous pizzeria job bc I made a lot of money from being overworked and doing everything myself. There were times a couple of people showed up with weapons, and the neighborhood itself is pretty bad too) so my BF and his mom don't want me working there for that reason. I recently quit my last job at Royal Farms and waiting on my taxes so I could pay her what I owe, but she wasn't having any of it. So she went on to text me that I'm inconsiderate, selfish, have no self worth, all that shit. My dad just lets it happen bc he'll always put her first (wanna know somethin juicy? She told me she put a hex on my dad. It involves blood, but not regular blood, if you catch my drift)\n\nIk I could just move back with my mom, but I don't want to leave my boyfriend behind and jeapordize our relationship. I could move in with my BF's family, but the house is already full enough bc of the baby his sis in law just had, and my stuff has nowhere to go. Ik I could just put my foot down, but it always comes out wrong and I'm deemed disrespectful bc I get so emotional.

Her mother was the one who found this out, after seeing the stepfather on the ground with his phone angled under the door while her daughter was in the shower. Most of the family has since found this out, and everyone is very upset about it except for her mother. I (22f) am trying provide support/ensure she is comfortable and safe from exploitation but am having a hard time reaching her. \n\nHer mother seems convinced that this behavior was an isolated incident and is doing everything she can to salvage her relationship with this man who was peeping on her daughter. The rest of the family is much less forgiving, many of them refusing to visit or take their kids near this man. Meanwhile, she is encouraging him to go to therapy and seems much more concerned about his well being than that of her own child who was subjected to this abuse. Her husband does not currently live with them, however he visits frequently enough that it is a regular thing. They talked to my niece about what happened, framing the situation as a misunderstanding more than an attack and seem to be brainwashing her into normalizing this incident and showering her in gifts as a way to move on and \u201creturn to normal.\u201d \n\nMany of us are concerned but are having a difficult time reaching out to her, as she is under a very watchful eye from her mother especially since this incident. My niece knows about it, but only from what her mother told her. The stepfather is temporarily moved out, but still spends several evenings a week there. Her biological father does not know. He visits occasionally, although he is also a drug addict and someone we are not eager to involve as custody with him would likely be dangerous in its own ways. I live in a city about 2 hours away, and only see them a few times a year. \n\nWhat would be the best approach to try and help my niece? What are some ways I may be able to speak to her without asking loaded questions? How to ask if she feels safe or understands what happened in a way that may help her feel comfortable answering without shame or embarrassment? I feel that it is important for her to understand that she experienced something significant, despite her mother and stepfathers attempts to brainwash her about this experience since she did not directly witness her stepfathers actions. What do you all feel is my best course of action?\n\nEdit: thank you all for the feedback and responses. I think we are going to contact cps today and tell them if the situation because nobody is advocating for her, and it seems like based on many peoples experiences that this isn\u2019t something that will simply stop. Our initial hesitation with contacting authorities is that her biological father is a very poor caretaker and drug addict, and we were afraid that it may lead to him having more custody which could hurt her in other ways. But since her mom isn\u2019t doing anything about this creep, I think we are obligated to at least tell them the situation.", "score": 36, "subreddit": "FamilyIssues", "best_comment": "What about getting CPS or the police involved?

She is trying to convince him to have a three way/let her have a one night stand with a woman.\n\nWell they had some kind of fight and she ended up coming over and spending the day with me, while my brother stayed home with their three kids and progressively got more and more drunk as the time passed.\n\nMy brother had called me and said to keep an eye on her, which I said I was. We had gone to the bar nearby and was just playing some pool, not even drinking, so I didn't think it was a big deal. Well she leaves, and I go home and think nothing of it.\n\nAbout two hours later my brother calls asking about her. I said we parted ways a while ago (they're about a 45 minute drive away) and haven't an idea where she could be.\n\nHe exploded on me that I agreed to watch her and should have called him the second she left my sight, and started going on about how she wants to sleep with anyone but him so she's obviously out there doing so right now. I explained I can't control where a grown woman goes after she gets in her own car, and I didn't think I needed to report to him like a babysitter for an adult. We hung out, she wasn't driving drunk, I did my duty.\n\nSo he switched it and started in on my husband, saying he was just like my brother's wife wanting nothing else than to sleep with anyone else but me. I calmly told him to not project his feelings into my relationship, but he continued to tell me how my husband is an obvious cheater and has no interest in me and was jealous at my sister in law's attempts at a three-way. Mind you I am currently  8 months pregnant with my husband of 7 years child.\n\nSo I hung up on him. Yesterday he was calling and texting me like he didn't say anything which makes me think he was too drunk to remember what he said, but I did not answer back. \n\nI can't pretend like he didn't outright attack my husband even if he doesn't remember saying it. I already know he'll give the excuse \"I was drunk\" like it should wash away all mistakes. Been there many times.\n\nI have no idea how to approach him about what he said, but I can't avoid him forever.\n\nAnd on the SIL situation, found out she had returned to the bar to watch the superbowl for a bit.

Am I the toxic one?", "id": "f80cr0", "body": "Hey guys before I get into it I\u2019m just going to explain what I\u2019m looking for in your replies / responses to this post.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering, is my relationship with my friend normal or toxic? If toxic, am I the toxic one or is he? Also, how should I go about fixing this problem? I\u2019ll try to explain everything as unbiased as possible.\n\nI met my best friend (Friend A) 8 years ago and there\u2019s been times when we\u2019ve both been toxic, but for the most part we have a healthy relationship. Anyways, I met (Friend B) 3 years ago and at first we had a healthy relationship but this past year he\u2019s been kind of a dick recently in MY opinion.\n\nWe would hang out once every 2 or 3 weeks and have sleepovers and shit like that for about 2 years. Recently however, when I ask if he wants to hang or vice versa, he\u2019ll say he can come-over in an hour or so. Then an hour turns to 2 then 4 then 6, then he can\u2019t come. This has happened about 4 times in a row during the last few weekends. Only later do I find out he\u2019s off hanging out with Friend A and maybe some other people.\n\nWhat pisses me off about this is, if he would just fucking tell me that he won\u2019t be able to hang out until really late or that he has other plans, that would be fine as I\u2019d just go hang out with other friends. But no, he has to waste my time all day saying he\u2019s on his way only to tell me 2 hours later he went out to eat with his family and he can\u2019t come anymore. (Then go hangout with someone else).\n\nHe does consider me and friend A to be his 2 closest friends but it doesn\u2019t feel that way to me. I\u2019ve addressed this multiple times but then he tries to make me feel like I\u2019ve done something wrong. Like he has to drop everything to come hang out with me. In reality if he would just tell me either A) He doesn\u2019t want to hang with me today or B) He can\u2019t, I\u2019d be totally fine with it and just go hang out with other friends. And I\u2019ve told him this. But for some reason he feels like he has to flake on me for 6 hours straight and waste my whole day.\n\nI\u2019m just considering dropping him because it doesn\u2019t seem like he even cares about how I feel. Only problem is I\u2019ve just gotten so used to hanging out with him almost every weekend even though I\u2019ve definitely got other people who will actually care enough to make solid plans with me.\n\nSo again, based on this would you guys say he is a toxic friend?

When I was dizzy for having a huge beer, you were with me. When I was walking the streets at night, my fingers were frozen but I kept texting you and you were with me.

I don't know why you do that. \n\nBut I know a day will come that you'll return. Slowly at first, then all at once. Just like the first time that we talked. Maybe you'll say you're sorry, or maybe you'll hope there's no need to. I'll ask you if there's anything we should talk about and - I know you - you'll say no. I won't say I completely forgave you, but I'll suggest to go watch the sky with my telescope. We'll have a pizza and we'll go by car.

I didn\u2019t know he sent her the photos since I was using my iPad and had left my phone in the other room not knowing my brother was going through my album. I was face timing her at the time than she started laughing and telling me how retarded I look and how ugly the faces I made were.  I asked her what she was talking about than realized my brother was probably using my phone. I than ended the face time and started to cry. I was still insecure of my looks and sensitive so when someone told me I was ugly I would shut down. I forgave my brother for doing that after he saw me breakdown and I also forgave my friend for saying those comments. \n\n    One time I was very confident of myself and met up with her and some other friends. I was with one of my other friends looking at some jewelry when I hear her say that I look like a grandma and those friends start laughing. I just pretend I don\u2019t hear it.

I said, \"I can.\" he said \"You should wear something nice but casual.\"  which I thought I was, but I changed away.  He approved of my new outfit and we got in the can and were on our way.  It wasn't long before I realized we weren't going into town but we were very close to an acquaintance's house.  A girl I barely new.  He dropped me off there and I realized that he had planned an outing with this girl (Who I'll call Jazzie) and I was the only one who had no idea what was happening.  Jazzie and I went out and had a great time.  We became really good friend after that.  Fast forward two and a half  years, she tells me she's planning to move to Ireland for a year, which I didn't like but I was supportive, like a good friend is. The time difference was killer but I did my best.  She, however, did not.  Fast forward again five months, she had to come home for two months before going back for another six months.  We picked thing up real fast but because she had a busy schedule we weren't able to hang out until a couple of weeks after she'd gotten home.  And when we finally got around to making plans to hang out she had invited two other friends.  At first I was a little disappointed but I knew she had a lot on her plate.  Finally the day came to go out with her and our two other friends.  Jazzie picked me up and everything went the way I figured it would.  It was really nice to spend time with her again, even if it wasn't just the two of us.  At the end of the evening when she was driving me home I asked her what her plans where for the next could of days, thinking we could find another day to hang out before she left again.  Her tone changed after that, we were very close to my house when she said she needed to have a \"hard conversation\".  I didn't understand at first.  When we pulled up to my house she turned the car off I realized  she meant she needed to have a hard conversation with me.  At that point I knew what was happening, and to be honest I wasn't really surprised.  She gave a few handfuls of crap reasons that she'd needed to talk to me; I wasn't supporting her (Which wasn't true), I wasn't as good as Claire, our lives were moving in different places, but most of all I had apparently told her of how so unhappy I was (Which wasn't true) and how hard it was everyday in Ireland knowing that I was unhappy.  (I'm sorry but I don't know anyone who breaks up with their best friend because that friend is unhappy, friends help unhappy friends.)  What she doesn't know is that I know the real reason she broke my heart is because her family isn't used to people they can't control.  They don't like me for that very small reason.  I don't care about them, But I do care very deeply for her and was willing to put up with her family because I truly believe that I am the only person in her life who has ever really loved her for everything she is.

When we first met she had moved from her previous state with her BF but she wore the pants in the relationship so i did not have those issues of another guy thinking I'm trying to take his girl it was a straight up friendship. Oh! i haven't said her name yet so we'll go with C. So me & C had a mutual friend, we'll call her J and i found out from another friend of mine that J claimed to be a lesbian but while J was staying with another friend we worked with she fucked her bf, when i first met J she claimed pussy harder than a BM looking for her BD on Maury so i made it my mission to prove she wasn't a full blown lesbian. Me, C, & J become good good friends and start hanging out ALOT, Me & J are now fucking at that time so things are cool well after awhile me & J stopped fucking around b/c i didn't really feel like it was worth continuing so we became distant, During all of this C's BF cheated on her so she moves out from the apartment and into the same complex as J. One weekend one of my boys i went to HS with comes down, we all go out and turn up great time & all!! my boy dips and I'm at C's house now but she's down the hall at J's Apartment, J didn't go out with us so it was kinda weird to me that C was over there but I'm drunk so  i don't stay on that thought long i was just trying to get laid so i text J saying I'm trying to eat the pussy hurry up so i go to Js Apartment & C says she wants to watch me fuck J b/c C claimed to be a virgin so of course I'm with it they're both very Attractive, other than some light flirting Me and C have never done anything we're just friends, J tells C to suck my dick and she does then they make out, best night of my life. After that i feel like things between me & C started going downhill, there was definitely some distance, less talking & honestly it sucked i never had a close female friend like that i was a fat fuck growing up and i lost all that weight and i was getting noticed finally. Over time J & C hung out more and i was kinda left on the back burner so i did my own thing. One day i call C b/c it had been awhile and i like checking in, i was going out that night and i wanted to invite C but when i told her J might be there she didn't like that, she said if she was gonna be there don't invite me, they had some petty arguments and were on/off at times but with young females in college that happens so i told her that i didn't want to get involved in their drama as drama between women is deeper on a level men won't understand so i wanted to stay out of it but she didn't like that she thought that was fake, we're in the same group and women argue, get over it and come back usually. A month goes by & i haven't heard from C in awhile and J had a BF so we weren't talking anymore like that, i had called C several weeks before but no answer C is a hustler so i just assumed she was working, she finally picks up to me and tells me how i chose J over her and how me & her were best friends & i did some fake ass shit.

She'd do little petty ass shit but it wasn't as petty as ending our friendship over not getting involved in drama with a mutual friend, it didn't even really matter that they were females b/c I've held her down in similar situations with random bitches. I'll be the first to say I'm not perfect, i made mistakes in our friendship, sometimes i feel like i did make the wrong decision but then i think was the little petty ways worth saving the friendship, i felt unappreciated.

In my friend group we\u2019ve got a certain friend who is a year younger than us and is... unique. She (a trans girl) grew up in not the best environment (but nothing very terrible) and has a history of almost breaking our friend group apart.\n\nI\u2019m gonna list a few scenarios so that everyone is on track.\n\nOur friend group (made up of about 15 people) talk a lot on Instagram and Discord. This friend (whom I will refer to as Abigail) kicked a friend of ours out of the server saying that they weren\u2019t \u201cone of the important guys\u201d. \n\nWe were a bit startled, since we\u2019ve never really had an argument.... ever. We didn\u2019t say much, but another friend came on and confronted Abigail about it. Abigail left the server shortly after being confronted. \n\nWe added her back, and our friend (I\u2019ll call him Henry) continued to ask her why she did that. Abigail immediately switched to playing the victim card.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, Henry\u2019s approach was very direct, but the friend whom was removed is known to be  depressed and often feels like things are their fault and has had instances of being not included in the past. Abigail had no right to do that.\n\nThey argued back and forth and Abigail eventually made Henry leave the group altogether. I, along with a few other friends, am still on good terms with him, though.\n\nWe added the friend back, and went along with stuff as normal. Well, not really. \n\nAnyways, on to Instagram issues.\n\nI made a chat for all of us, and gave me and about three other friends admin. \n\nAbigail has a tendency to yell at us if we remove her as a joke. On Instagram, if you\u2019re an admin you can remove people. We have done that to pretty much everyone in the chat, though wild add them back within a minute. \n\nEventually, I gave Abigail admin, and she proceeded to remove everyone\u2019s admin except for hers. Asking her why, she told me she \u201cdidn\u2019t trust me enough\u201d even though at that point we\u2019d been very close friends for about four to five months. \n\nThis may sound a bit petty, but Abigail is arguably the least responsible out of our group. She will make rash/brash decisions on a whim without thinking of consequences. She uses emotions before logic. \n\nBeing told she didn\u2019t trust me after all of the times I\u2019ve backed her up, argued for her, and had fun times with her kind of hurt, but I stayed silent.\n\nA few weeks after, Abigail had a \u201ccontest\u201d for admin. The contestants were all the admins from before: Theta and I. The contest was about.... her. Basically, it was a quiz consisting of facts about her. We passed, but to get admin had to draw for her, while I had to make... fanfiction that I really didn\u2019t want to write.\n\nAnyways, did that, and got admin back. Whatever, I guess.\n\nWe have multiple chats on Instagram. Abigail did not have admin in one of them. She asked for it, and I reluctantly gave it.\n\nNot even a second later, she proceeded to remove everyone\u2019s admin. Luckily, I was able to predict this and remove her admin from an alt account of mine before she could finish.\n\nShe whined but didn\u2019t acknowledge it besides that.\n\nAnyways, to the present day.\n\nI, Theta, and two other responsible individuals had admin. It\u2019s been almost two months since Abigail abused her admin privileges, so I decided to give her another chance and give it to her.\n\nEverything for fine for about thirty minutes. We were all laughing and whatnot. Then, she removes everyone\u2019s admin, save for two people. (I\u2019m not sure of their opinion towards her, so u will keep them Anon. They didn\u2019t talk back against her, so I assume they\u2019re fine with it.)\n\nI asked here again why she removed everyone\u2019s admin. This time, she says: \u201cbecause only the responsible people should have admin\u201d.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m somewhat done with her bullshit, and start to argue against her. She plays off what I said as a joke, so I just stopped.\n\nI would remove her, but she\u2019s dating Theta and it would cause a lot of unnecessary drama.\n\nI have screenshots if necessary to understand better (though the screenshots with Abigail and Henry are the most damning).\n\nTLDR; Hypocritcal, sensitive, and somewhat emotionally manipulative friend who runs away from confrontation.

One is probably my closest/oldest group. It\u2019s two of my friends from high school (M and K), my best friend (J) who I\u2019ve known since grade 3 (but left my school in grade 8) who I introduced to the high school gals and gets along with them well. And the last person is probably my oldest friend (H) who I\u2019ve known since we were 4 and who is the problem here. \n\nShe was always a pretty shitty and manipulative person growing up, but I never really realized it until I was about 12. After that I distanced myself from her and we lost touch. Then when we were about 17 J decided she would invite H to hang out one time (they also knew each other a bit in elementary school). I\u2019m like sure what\u2019s the harm in getting coffee. We do it and find out that H has gone through a lot of changes. She has realized she was shitty and is a much better person. Slowly we see her more at like parties and stuff to begin with. \n\nThen maybe two years ago at (20ish yrs old) we actually become really close with her. She becomes part of the group but mostly really close with me. Let me add that prior to our group she has never been good at having female friends and usually ended up just chilling with her bf at the time and his friends. I start to feel like she is one of my closest friends and we talk a lot. She can\u2019t drive so I would usually give her a ride and we would always get into long intense convos on the way home or in her driveway. \n\nSlowly she started to tell me things she didn\u2019t really like about the others in the group. High school pair, bestie and I have been hanging out as a group for years and we have our problems, but it\u2019s just normal shit like most friend groups have. I would also tell her about how I didn\u2019t like something one had done as well sometimes. Like normal venting shit between friends.\n\nK who is one of the high school friends is a little different than the rest of us. Let me add that H finished uni in May, J finished college two years ago, K + me just finished in Dec and M will finish this May. We all went to different schools but hang out every summer and Christmas break. K got into a weird crowd at uni and it kinda made her quite negative and got her into the mind set of you gotta hate everything to be cool. We as a group don\u2019t love this about her but accept her. I\u2019ve had others outside the group also comment on how they don\u2019t really like K (one being my mom). She can be annoying a lot, but we still love her and live with her bad qualities because we like her good ones enough. H doesn\u2019t like her very much and always talks to me about how she doesn\u2019t like her attitude. And as much as I agree with H about K sometimes, I have kinda just have distanced myself from K a little. \n\nH and K have in the past posted some low key sub tweets at each other before but usually it\u2019s not a big deal but still kinda rude. They clearly don\u2019t really like each other but are friends with the same people. However, H recently accepted a masters offer in Italy (were from Canada) and left in Jan for a year. Everything has been chill but we haven\u2019t heard much from her. \n\nThen today, she goes off on a huge rant on Twitter about how everyone in Italy and the rest of the world is so much more positive and nicer than the people from our city and how she doesn\u2019t wanna be associated with negative people. She uses a screen shot from K\u2019s twitter as an example of this and then unfollows everyone she knows. Idk what to do.\n\n[screen shots of tweets available if you message me and wanna know full context lol]\n\nThe rant was very mean spirited and honestly was verging on cyber bullying in my opinion. I really thought this friend had moved past her horrible childhood and finally made some female friends. I know that there were things about our group (and K in particular) that really bugged her, but why didn\u2019t she just talk to us? Has she met new people in Italy who influenced her to do this? This seems super out of character for present day her. \n\nI spoke to J and M about it today and they are very hurt and just as confused as me. I don\u2019t even know if K has seen the tweets yet. I get that K can be annoying, but I feel like airing you dirty laundry masked as rant all over the internet is not a mature way to handle things. What do I do?

Sorry.", "id": "f4u9ig", "body": "Ok, long story and I will try to be as concise as I can.  \n\nI have lived about a thousand miles from home since I was 22 - about 18 years. I visit \u201chome\u201d probably four or five times a year and stay with my sister and her family typically when Im there.  My sister and her hubs drink a lot - and they have a very large social circle, often entertaining at their house so I know most of their friends pretty well. I\u2019m recently divorced and I think I\u2019m a little better than average looking.  Nothing crazy, but def not ugly. \n\nThis past week when I was visiting home, my sister invited me out with two of her girlfriends and a guy friend of theirs that I\u2019d never met. They\u2019ve known him several years but he travels for work and our paths have just never crossed before. I had a meeting for work and ended up arriving late and when I walked in to the bar, it was my sister and her husband, my sister\u2019s single best friend and that new guy I had never met, so it wasn\u2019t the three of us girls and one guy that I expected. I went to go sit down next to my sister and they directed me to an open seat in the corner of the bar by NewGuy. \nThe way we were seated, I was in the corner at the other end of our group and couldn\u2019t really see the tv they were all watching/ discussing and I was far enough from everyone that I had to make it a point to be part of the conversation.  NewGuy was right next to me and talked to me. He talked to me A LOT. His sister arrived late also and joined the group sitting on the other side of him, separating him from the other single girl there. \n\nFast forward 2-3 hours and everything was friendly and nice but he made it very clear he was interested in me. I gave him my number and I was pretty excited to meet someone.  Since I was just visiting, he asked what my plans were for the next couple days and we vaguely talked about how/when we could get together before I left. We parted ways. \n\nI was only drinking water all night so naturally, I was the DD back to my sister\u2019s house.  As soon as we get in the car, my sister starts asking me questions about my conversation with NewGuy rather aggressively and was shocked we exchanged numbers because low and behold, the other single girl there is kind of dating him!!  Then my sister changed her tune to her friend likes him and they\u2019re friends and they hang out sometimes - but nothing has ever happened. \n\nI legitimately did not know that the other girl was into him. No one said anything to me beforehand or while we were there and I had gotten up to go to the bathroom at least three or four times while we were there where my sister would have had the opportunity to discreetly say something to me. \n\nMy sister and her friend are furious with me, saying I should have known, I should have asked and they can\u2019t believe how inappropriate I was to give him my number.  To note, I did not have his number and he texted me to make sure we got home ok and somehow we ended up talking that night for another half hour on the phone at like midnight.  \n\nI did end up hanging out with him before I left. We went out for drinks the night before I left and we stayed up until 6 am talking. In the course of conversation, he mentioned he had no interest in the other girl whatsoever, that he had been seeing someone long distance but they were currently taking a break, trying to figure out their next move and my sister\u2019s friend was well aware of all of that. He was a perfect gentleman towards me - flirty, but didn\u2019t make a move. He may have, but I fell asleep on his couch using him as my pillow.  I ended up leaving while he was sleeping bc I needed to get back.  We talked about keeping in touch and leaving it with, you never know where things can lead, but it all starts with being friends. \n\nOne final thing to note - the other single girl doesn\u2019t really date much.  She\u2019s pretty, successful, independent, normal as far as I know. She\u2019s pretty consistently crushing on someone in their friend group and as my sister puts it, gets \u201cfriend zoned\u201d all the time. And I\u2019m usually clued in and warned about the dynamic in advance as to keep my distance. \n\nAnyway, the whole situation was just especially weird this time I guess. But I\u2019m still doubting myself as to how I handled it. Like was I really an ass in all of this?  I\u2019m back where I actually live now and I feel guilty like I came in town and shook things up and left. And I may never hear from this guy again.   Do I owe the other girl an apology?

Honestly, people hate or like me; like me because I tend to carry all the burden and so it leaves them with less things to do, this pertains to school works btw. They like me because I always give my 100% to friendship, going miles and beyond for people. However, they hate me because I have this authoritative aura they say. Because of this, it was hard to make genuine relationships because it always felt transactional; I always felt used. That led me to closing my doors to peole and I became more conscious of my environment. I have decided to try to fit in to the preferences of people - become more outgoing etc which I knew for a fact was not me. \n\nHowever, things changed when I decided to be myself. I've always thought that I will have friends when I try to become like them but that never was successful because at the end of the day, it felt fake and I didn't have the guts to try and put up a mask every single day. \n\nLittle did I know that becoming true to myself enabled me to meet genuine people. These people at times have different views than me. They have unique interest that I may not be fond of however most of the time, we come into a common denominator. The friendship that we have is not perfect since we don't always get to spend time together but when we do, we usually go all out.\n\nWhat I'm trying to imply is that I think the moment you become true to yourself is the moment you'll realize that indeed you are worthy of being called a friend, a true friend. And in such state will meet people who will appreciate you for who you truly are. Also, sometimes we tend to overlook things, the people whom you've been searching for is near you actually. These are the people you question because you think your interests are opposites when in fact they are complimentary. Lastly, don't rush it, go with the flow and you'll eventually get there.\n\nI am open to talk btw.

He says the condom sucks and that\u2019s inconsiderate of me to ask him to only wear condoms.

I know your mom isn't completely crazy as some of these commenters are suggesting because they've never met her, but she seems like a down to earth person when she's level headed (at least from my experiences with her, you know her better than anyone obviously). She certainly doesn't seem to be the level of crazy Karen that some of these internet strangers are assuming. You're both going through a lot with all of this court stuff and your dad and it's most likely taking a big toll on her as much as it does on you as well.  \n  \nStand your ground. If you apologize, it's admitting defeat and sending a subconscious message to your mom that doing that crap is excusable. If she tries to use the breakdown as an excuse for hitting you, don't accept it. Mothers should know not to hit their kids even when in this kind of state.

You don't have to do it with your dad (unless the state is already making you, but if it is maybe you could go to a separate thing), just your mom and maybe your sister. There, you could discuss your feelings about this whole situation with your dad and the court and try to understand each others' points of view together. Because from what I've heard from you, it sounds like something (if not the court thing) is taking a big toll on your mom and professionals can help you guys heal together.  \n  \nAlso sorry if this advice seems too personal, I just want to try and give you advice I guess.

Emotions are very often damn liars and if you refuse to build emotional connections with a good guy then who is to say you can find better? Or that this won\u2019t be a persistent issue? It takes work to stay in love and commitment and discussion. You have to communicate that there is this issue of not feeling loved and if you don\u2019t communicate that before leaving then that\u2019s pretty hurtful because you say he loves you and you haven\u2019t given him a chance to fight to get you back yet.

I normally styled my hair in a way so people wouldn't have to see my face. The day before my first year of highschool I watched some hairstyle tutorials and decided to put my hair up in a bun. I felt it looked cute so despite my insecurities I decided to be brave enough to wear it to my first day of high school.\n\nThe moment I stepped into school I saw my best friend (let's call her Melody). I was very happy about seeing her but she didn't seem so happy to see me. The first thing she told me was that my hairstyle made me look like a horse. It was the first time someone had said something like that to me. I felt so bad and immediately went to the bathroom to take off the bun to hide my face. For the rest of that year I didn't wear my hair up in fear that I would look like a horse. If my own best friend said something like that to me, what would everyone else say? \n\nThe next year our P.E. teacher was forcing the girls with long hair to wear it in a ponytail, I felt so sick and anxious just thinking about it so I lied about not having a hair tie. Melody and the rest of my friends pressured me for the rest of that day to wear my hair in a ponytail the next day, so I did. I was scared shitless when I walked into school, but to my surprise I didn't receive any negative comments from my classmates. \n\nQuite the contrary, people kept complimenting me. They told me that ponytails suited me because I had a good facial structure, recommended me other hairstyles they thought would also look good on me and compared me to two of my favorite celebrities. \n\nOne girl from my class told me that when I wore my hair up I kind of looked like Ariana Grande and many of the other girls agree while others said I reminded them of Audrey Hepburn. I was ecstatic, being compared to such beautiful women felt so good, until that moment I had never felt beautiful. But it didn't last for long, Melody butted in and said that I looked like the Walmart version of them. I didn't wear my hair again until I was in my senior year of high school. \n\nIn my country all high school seniors have to do a mandatory social work to graduate. My classmates and I had to plant a bunch of trees and pick up garbage. Despite my insecurities I tied my hair since it was such a hot day. Once again, I got compliments from the people around me, though this time I convinced myself they were all lying. For the following days that we did this social work I used my hair in an updo and received compliments for it every day. \n\nDuring our lunch break Melody and I decided to eat on our own away from our class. She looked like something was bothering her so I asked her if everything was okay. She avoided my question and instead asked me why I was wearing my hair up. That was the question she asked, but her eyes asked me a different question, \"are you wearing it up just because they tell you it looks pretty?\" they seemed to ask. I told her the truth but she didn't seem to believe me. Also, during this time there was this cute guy in my class who liked me. Out of the blue she told me \"____(His name) only likes you because you're skinny, if I was thin he wouldn't even acknowledge you\", her words hurt me, but it made me realize that she hated me, she had probably hated me from the start. \n\nSorry, I know this whole issue sounds vain, but this is something that has been troubling me for years. I'm in college now and I don't want to be friends with her anymore. I'm not sure why Melody does it, but I'm sick of it. I don't want her to apologize or give me an explanation, all I want is to have her out of my life, I don't want to sound hurtful though. How should I end our friendship without being mean?

I still love her and would get back with her in a heart beat if she would even talk to me. Unfortunately, her dad is a paranoid ex cop and had her put a restraining order on me and, without getting to much into it, has quite a bit of power over her in using fear and guilt tactics to control her life choices. Bottom line, he just doesn\u2019t like me because I put a stop to his weird behaviors in the course of our 3 year relationship and took this as his opportunity to regain lost territory.

I\u2019m a technician and my work is always in a new location every day, but I do have to go to our HQ office to pick up parts and tools that I\u2019ll need for the day as well as touch base with our office staff who mainly stays in contact with my customers. It\u2019s a big team effort and the office staff/technician team relationship feels a lot like a big family, and it\u2019s a light hearted fun atmosphere. \n\nSo, I noticed right away that one of the women in the office was attracted to me, was giving me a lot of attention, and made a lot of excuses to have side conversations with me away from the rest of the team. She was very smiley, joked a lot, and slightly flirtatious. I reciprocated the friendliness and I enjoyed her attention but I also just playing it cool because internally I felt conflicted about allowing this flirtation because I\u2019m not used to opening that proverbial door from woman other than my (ex) girlfriend. So, over the course of the last almost full 3 weeks, I\u2019ve just been playing it cool, the other guys in the office definitely noticed the chemistry between us but I just smile and tell them I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. \n\nThis last week I had to spend some extra time at the office and ended up getting to know her quite a bit more. We asked each other a lot of personal questions and I realized that we actually do have a lot in common in terms of interests, family dynamics, and the sexual attraction is pretty strong. I noticed the next day that she was super dolled up, and had her full make up on, and was making a lot of time to have more conversations. At one point I had to call her desk phone with my personal cell, and my ex\u2019s name came up on her caller ID, it made my heart sink and she noticed it, I basically just explained that I was in the process of transferring my phone from her account to my own due to a recent breakup.

She has written on her arm with permanent marker every day at school \"I love my [First name] [last name]. She is however very self centered, as in talks for hours about every little thing that makes her happy, and I listened because I cared about her, but when I talk I have to work like hell to actually be heard, when I try bringing it up she blames her ADHD and if I am not careful she will spiral into talking about how she was bullied all throughout school blah blah blah. She hates everything that I am super passionate about, except for maybe music. I found out that she broke up with her ex because he stopped talking to her. She is lazy, as in she asks her siblings to do everything for her, she shit talks them and only says half the story.

The concerning lies are the ones involving exes etc, but she literally tried convincing me monsters attacked during the night one time, and that they killed them and the police collected the bodies.

It's gotten a lot better this year, and I'm kind of recovering from mid last year where I almost died. I've spending a lot of effort trying to get my shit together, failing many times, but getting better at getting my shit together every time. \nUntil the last few months of last year it was diagnosed as moderate because I had no dark thoughts and not at risk but was still bedridden, at the start of this year I had a peak of happiness and have been consistently happier than I have been for close to 8-10 years, and after moving away from home and becoming more independent I have been feeling amazing, I even started doing things I used to enjoy doing which is a huge step for me. Everything is looking up, then this relationship I feel a bit tied up and restricted. I still have the occasional bad day. \nIf I used my head I'd knew that this relationship was a very bad idea. But I had literally no friends near me when I moved, and had very very few friends who made me feel good. I guess I just lapped up the attention she gave.

I'm here to give you a point of view that you don't seem to be getting from these posts.  Here it is.\n\nYou sound you have an anxiety problem.  Your comments about stress eating and uncontrollable weight gain as a result tell me that you are having significant anxiety issues that are not being properly managed.  I strongly suggest that you seek out professional therapy to help manage your anxiety before you start to do anything else drastic.\n\nYour anxiety is probably bleeding over into the relationship in other areas as well.  How are other parts of it?  Are there lots of little arguments over random things?  How is your affection outside of the bedroom?  Are you able to connect with him well when you two are together at home alone, or do you find yourself playing on your phone or computer on social media instead of interacting with him?\n\nIf nothing changes at this point, your relationship is likely going to limp along into a semi-sexless friendship that eventually leads to some sort of long term commitment that neither of you are thrilled about, or, one of you will get fed up and break up.  I day this because your anxiety is likely paralyzing your ability to make a decision here, and your partner obviously loves you enough to stay with you even if he's not into how you look at present.  If he was just a superficial asshole, he likely would have been blunt with you and moved on to some other woman.\n\nYou need to keep in mind that sustained attraction is about more than physical beauty.  It includes personality, mannerisms, and most of all the ability to be vulnerable with your partner.  That it took you basically having to fight an answer out of him tells me that he doesn't really trust you with the truth about things that are tough.  Look at your post; your internal breakdown over this statement speaks to your underlying anxiety and how it likely affects every aspect of your relationship.\n\nFor context, I have been where your partner is.  My SO is a stress eater with major anxiety problems.  She eventually gained over 100 lbs during our marriage and her anxiety ruined almost every aspect of our relationship, including sex.  While I won't say that the weight wasn't visually off-putting, I still loved her and desired her very much through it all.  No matter what she weighed, I always found her face beautiful and was physically attracted to her.  She eventually got surgery and lost all the weight, buy, by then, the damage was done.  Her anxiety had devoured every aspect of \"us\" and her current personal boundaries with me are that I can never touch her, hug her, kiss her, tell her I love her, or openly communicate with her about any sort of issue with the lack of sex, affection, or any other aspect of the relationship.  Her reasoning is that any of that gives her tremendous anxiety and it always becomes an argument.\n\nDon't let your relationship get to that point.  Manage your anxiety then work on your relationship.  It'll probably take therapy for him to be able to get to a point where he feels able to be vulnerable with you.\n\nOr\n\nEnd the relationship now, which will reduce your anxiety, find ways of managing your anxiety through therapy and get yourself into a good headspace and then try another relationship.", "second_best_comment": "I don\u2019t know, you said you gained 20 pound but lost 5-6 in a mean time so you are heavier then before 14-15 pounds and to me it\u2019s not that big difference in your appearance...\n\nI think something kinda broke between you two when he confessed that and I agree, everyone would feel like that...

None of this is easy to admit; I want to be as honest as possible here. \n\n\nHis children\u2019s mother accused me of stealing before. He never mentioned it after she asked him about it and I had to find out through mutual friends.\n\nHe told his friend explicit details about our sex life, and his friend made a joke directly to me in front of him. It wasn\u2019t clear with what he said, but I was able to figure it out. My husband lied at first but gave in after I asked him a second time.\n\nFour years ago, he went out and got drunk in the city with friends and ended up texting multiple old friends including four different woman. I found this out by going through his phone while he was sleeping. Three of the conversations were deleted; two I found out about later which I will get to next, and one was a text saying \u201csorry I\u2019m just seeing this now\u201d with no previous message from him. \n\n\nI was feeling particularly nervous about one girl in particular, so I fabricated a story about a \u201cparty\u201d I was going to with mutual friends of one of the girls who he texted. This is how I found out he talked to her, he freaked out and said he \u201cscrewed up\u201d and told her she looked cute but that was the extent to it. \n\nThe other woman I found out he had spoken to wasn\u2019t for another year or so, but was through a similar situation; I made something up. I flipped out and pretended I spoke to her because I had a gut feeling and I was right. He said it was six months before and also the night he spoke to the other women and deleted them, but that it didn\u2019t mean anything and that after we had gotten into a fight, he asked her to send him pictures of her in a shirt she had recently gotten.\n\nAt a different work event 3 years ago, he went out and got drunk with them and didn\u2019t respond to my texts after 8p.m. I didn\u2019t say anything else after that because I didn\u2019t want to seem overbearing. He showed up at my (old) house at 4 a.m. crying and saying \u201cI\u2019m such a dick\u201d over and over and when I asked why he says he just feels bad because he didn\u2019t answer me... wtf?\n\nWhen I think of these things, it breaks my heart and scares the hell out of me. When he\u2019s drinking he seems to get overly horny, always scoping out other women and can\u2019t even help himself from talking to them. He says it isn\u2019t in a flirtatious way but to me it seems it is.. but I also ALWAYS feel that way. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something wrong with me, if I\u2019m being too controlling or if I\u2019m just being played for a fool... he never would have told me anything in the first place if I hadn\u2019t had to pull it out of him. He swears nothing else ever happened but how the hell would I ever know that? I just magically knew the only times he ever texted someone in a flirty way?\n\nHe\u2019s going to a work event next month and will be getting drunk. It annoys the hell out of me and I mentioned what he did the last few times and he walked out of the room and has avoided me the rest of the night. I don\u2019t think he gives a shit about how he\u2019s hurt me in the past and I don\u2019t know if I can trust him not to do it again. If anything I think he just learned not to believe me when I make things up to get him to admit things. \n\n\nI feel we\u2019re both wrong in our own ways... what can I do to stop feeling this way? What can I do to make things work?\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m controlling and my husband lies, what do I do now", "score": 3, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "best_comment": "You guys should go to marriage counseling and he needs to go to AA and stop drinking.", "second_best_comment": "Sounds like you don\u2019t trust him at all, but for some good reasons.

He uses it to share what's going in his life on a daily basis), where he has roughly 50 followers. Most of them are mutual friends and people in our social circle. Now to add cream to the pie, I went through my messages and saw that he had explicitly shared these same screenshots in a group chat with a bunch of our friends. Both in the caption of the post and in the group chat he was laughing at my situation.\n\nObviously, I texted him to take the post down, but unfortunately he had gone to sleep. Later today I happened to check my instagram again and despite my messages which he saw and acknowledged in the morning, the post still stood. After calling him he did end up taking the post down and apologised.\n\nThis is actually not the first time he does something similar. Back in autumn he posted someone's passport photo on the same account, where the person happened to have really silly and bad hair. Also on numerous occasions he has posted photos of people he's hanging out with, including me. He has never asked for permission on any of the cases.\n\nI am not as much worried about the fact that all of our mutual friends now know my embarassing story, but I am more concerned over the fact that I don't understand how could I trust him anymore. Next thing I know he might be going around campus gossiping about all I've done.\n\nI don't know how to move on, since he is a really good friend of mine and generally a nice dude, but now that I do think about it, he lacks a sense of seeing things through other people's perspectives.

I started off only seeing Haley as a friend for most of that year since she had a crush on one of my other friends/roommates (21M) who I'll just refer to as Kevin. She would ask me and my other roommates how and where Kevin was, what he was doing, etc... basically making it very obvious that she was interested in Kevin. Well not too long after, Kevin made it rather clear that he didn't have the same feelings for Haley by dating another girl, which Haley found out about through me and my roommates so she obviously didn't take it too well. \n\nFast forward a couple of months and Haley still hangs out with my other roommates (excluding Kevin) and I rather consistently. The next school year Haley and I grow a lot closer as friends since we hang out and text each other consistently. Sometimes we'll go to school events with my other roommates (excluding Kevin) to hang out while other times we would go to the gym together or just text each other random stuff about our day. At some point I realized that I'm starting to develop feelings for Haley, which made me uncomfortable and honestly confused everytime I would think about it.

Specifically, she sent me a thirsty Valentine's copy pasta specifically related to our school and in particular my major, which I didn't know if I should just interpret as a funny little meme she found and just wanted to share or if it had any other meanings behind it. She would also tell me random stuff when we'd go to the gym together like how her panties were loose or some shit like that. At some points in the past she would mention to me directly that she used Tinder and I wouldn't think too much of it since I hadn't developed feelings for her at that time. However, yesterday I just discovered from other people that she's recently been going on Tinder dates which kinda took me by surprise and honestly hurt to hear.

I knew the birthday boy and his mates from a previous encounter with mutual friends. During the night, I remember seeing one of his mates (let\u2019s call him Thomas) and he introduced me to a guy named Billy. After chatting with Thomas and Billy, they asked me to join them at the bar to buy a drink. I joined and being a little tipsy I didn\u2019t watch if the bartender poured the drink or where it came from. Thomas handed me the shot, I drank it, and we went back to the table. Within 10 mins, I felt everything was slowed down, vision blurry, and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. It seemed like I blacked out. \n\nAfter that, I only remember little bits of that night in the following order:\n1. I remember my best friend (Lily) pulling me away to sit down and handing me water. (apparently Billy was touching me) \n2. I remember sitting at the table and being dragged by Billy to dance and making out. \n3. I remember someone dragging me out of the club (turns out it was Billy) and one of my friends (Amanda) handing me her jacket. \n4. I remember going back to the table to put back her jacket and grab my own. \n5. I remember stopping and puking outside of a car ride several times. \n6. I remember being on his bed on my side with blind eyes and feeling his d.ick and it having a condom and another time without a condom.\n7. I remember I asked him if he came inside me and he said \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nI woke up in the morning and seeing his face and remembering him from the night club but confused how I got myself in this situation. I was scared and didn\u2019t know what to do. I checked google maps and found out I was very far from where my home is and the nearest station. I checked my texts and saw Amanda was the only person who texted me that Lily left with a guy (Mike) I knew. I didn\u2019t want to anger Billy so I politely asked if he can bring me to where Lily is\n\nWhen I saw Lily and Mike, they told me I got super drunk at the table and that no one saw me leave that night. But here I am thinking that I remember Amanda saw me leaving by handing me her jacket. They also told me that everyone was looking for me, but I received no text or calls from anyone asking where am I or where did I go. I didn\u2019t even receive any texts on my well being. On the other hand, Lily had the same shot as me from Thomas and she too blacked out.\n\nI asked several people from the night club if they knew what happened to me and they either said they don\u2019t know or they never replied.\n\n5 Days later, I decided to go to the doctor to get checked. And was recommended to report to the police. I said my statement to the police in the recording and they took me to the hospital to get a forensic test done. Now, I\u2019m just waiting for results. \n\nThey posted pictures of that night and I was the only person out of 20 people that did not get tagged. The other two girls I went with that night unfollowed me on instagram. I asked Lily what happened and she admitted that she was told by Amanda to go the predrink with everyone that night but to not bring me. But Lily said she won\u2019t be going if I\u2019m not going. Feeling backstabbed by Amanda, I felt like I didn\u2019t want to talk to her or confide with her.\n\nI want to know what happened to me that night. Did my drink get spiked? What is up with my girlfriends? Why doesn\u2019t anybody know what happened to me? Why is no one replying to me?

Well I guess something snapped in me tonight during an argument and I ended it. I let her roommates know about this and asked for them to keep an eye on her. About 20 minutes after I left, I got a text from her roommate asking for her parents phone number without any other context, so I sent it but then started to fear the worst. 30 mins later when I got home I pushed for why they needed it and was told that theyre  in the hospital with her and that she overdosed on stimulants (im inferring that it was her prescribed adderall).

As the months went on I may have developed a slight crush with one of the leaders (18, yikes I know..), let's call him 'Ben' this 'crush' was kind of on and off for the next 4 years but more on that...\nAbout a year later I was talking to this boy, let's call him 'Andy' and things got a bit risque but nothing ever happened and he got himself a girlfriend and it all died down and nothing happened again until I was almost 17 and 'Andy' and his girlfriend (the same girl he was speaking to after we stopped speaking) broke up. He'd been out of my mind for a while and let's say I was kinda into 'Ben' still but due to the 4 year difference I had told myself no because it could never happen. About a month after 'Andy's' breakup he joined my friendship group at school and we became close friends and when our teacher moved our maths room we ended up next to each other and let's just say we blossomed. We would talk all the time and let's say I was falling hard and fast. \nThis came to a staggering halt about 3 months later when the summer holidays came about and I found out he'd been smoking weed and not told me - before you bite my ear off, looking back it was a complete overreaction but I was still furious that he'd lied to me because I'm quite against smoking and definitely against drugs like that- so we didn't speak all summer\nSo, during this summer I went on a summer camp with this club and of course 'Ben' was there. We did so many activities with the young people from climbing to kayaking to jumping off cliffs into water and it was, hands down one of the best weeks of my life. On the last night all of us leaders were sat around the camp fire drinking beer. Before long, all the older leaders called it a night so it was just me and a couple of others and 'Ben'. After a while it was just Ben and I left. We sat talking around this campfire for hours and hours and eventually until the sun rose. After this we decided we should definitely go to bed so we threw the empty bottles in the bin (we were a little bit intoxicated) and go for a piss and then bed. We walked up to the toilet block and pissed funnily enough and then walked back. Honestly, that night was one of the best nights of my life. Hands down. No regrets.\n\nWe [me and \"Ben\"] didn't meet again over summer so it all kind of went away and I was back to being a strong independent woman. In September we went back to school and I was now in my final year. 'Andy' and I decided to remain friends and did so maybe a little too well. I used to swim and we [me and 'Andy'] decided to meet up briefly after I'd swam. I agreed and we ended up walking to this little park area and we ended up making out. This was my first kiss. After that the months flew by and we became official about 2 months later and had had sex less than a month after that. This was all about a year and a half ago and I am so unbelievably in love with him, he's amazing and I know he loves me unbelievable amounts too however I can't seem to get over 'Ben'. It could never have happened and I'm not sure I ever want it to.

I said this all in good fun, assuming I knew the answer after dating for 2.5 years.\n\nI wasn't asking out of any insecurity. I love the way I look and I know it's unique. I go out regularly with friends and get hit on all the time at bars, at work, at the grocery store even. I have random little girls come up and tell me I'm pretty, I have people in my DMs all the time. It's just not really a concern of mine so I guess I had never fished for a compliment with him before.\n\nThe next day though, he told me that he lied. He didn't actually think I was pretty and never has. I didn't ask him this, he told me he had to get it off his chest because he had been holding it in so long.\n\nOf course that just didn't make sense to me. He told me after a few days of fighting that he is attracted to me. Has always been attracted to me, That he adores and admires and respects me blah blah blah. But instead of saying I am beautiful for those other things, he told me he kept seeing me after our first date to prove to himself that he isn't all about looks, but he hasn't been able to get past it. I pointed out to him that we met on tinder and his response was \"your pictures were good I guess\". But I don't filter my photos or anything??\n\nEssentially he's saying my not being pretty (in his own opinion! He says it's probably not other people's opinion) has bothered him enough for him to consider breaking up with me a few times.

She was once a guy. This is important because dating trans people is actually different from dating cis. She's quite early in her transition and so she's taking hormones and going thru second puberty. She's emotional, and cries a lot. You might think this is because of the HRT but no, she's always been emotional. As a boy, she would cry a lot too. The HRT only made it worse.   \n\n\nI'm a female, but I was raised in a weird way. I got the rule for men that we shouldn't cry and that we should conceal our emotions from a young age. My mom didnt see it as a man's thing, but as a practical piece of advice. I learned very young that crying was a sign of weakness and that getting too emotional would make you lose any argument. At this point, I find it extremely difficult to cry. I have anxiety and depression, and when I'm upset, I still cant cry. I'll sob, I'll cry heave, but my eyes are dry. At most I can muster up a single tear and crying has never been a thing I have been able to do. I think this is the reason why I feel into self harm and addiction as a teen... (it's all resolved now, dw).  \n\n\nAs a results, my girlfriend and I are polar opposites when it comes to emotions. When she cries, I get extremely uncomfortable. I still hug and comfort her while she's upset, but I rather not see that. She'll text me sometimes on how she's crying and she tells me that on any given week, she cries like 3 times a week. Sometimes even crying herself to sleep.   \n\n\nI really love her and I want to be there for her, but I'm not happy with baby sitting somebody who needs this type of care.   \n\n\nShe's also very clingy, and sometimes tries to keep me from going home, so I get home late and sometimes I get in trouble for it.
